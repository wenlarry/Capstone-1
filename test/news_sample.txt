The president in this one isn't Bush-ish at all -- he wants to ratify the Kyoto Protocol -- but neither is he central to the plot (apart from being its target). The hero, played with tediously tight-jawed intensity by Michael Douglas, is a veteran Secret Service agent named Pete Garrison. He's the one who's having an affair with the First Lady (Kim Basinger, looking thoughtful and regretful, though not necessarily in that order). Pete is also the one who comes under suspicion as a traitor, thou

And don’t forget the sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat to protect yourself from the sun.

It isn't brunch without the truck's excellent chilaquiles: freshly fried tortilla chips enrobed in a cascabel chile sauce and topped with pickled onions, queso fresco and a fried egg.

The Magi meet Mary and Joseph, and it's curious that the child is never identified by name as Jesus or Christ. It seems strange, but, as Landau explains, there is an intentional reason for this omission: "If the Magi in the first-person narrative come to the end of the story without ever using the name, this implies that they have had an experience of Christ without ever knowing this savior figure as Christ. The case of the Magi, then, raises the possibility that Christ has appeared to many peo

I don't blame you for being skeptical. We've heard a half-dozen deadlines that were not met. However, the fact that Checketts and Game Plan are suggesting that it will be done before the start of the season isn't a hunch. As we discussed earlier in the chat, there are bank deadlines involved now. Checketts got one extension, but he's not going to get another. The Blues must be sold very soon. To me, it's not a matter of if the Blues will be sold soon. The question is, will the five groups invol

Since Mamet is an undeniably gifted writer, there are a number of amusing lines (Smith's popularity numbers are said to be "lower than Gandhi's cholesterol"). But many others are predictable political jabs that draw no blood: "What is it about me that people don't like?" "That you're still here."

Shoppers don't have to worry about bodily assault on Cyber Monday, when they shop from their computer, which may be why early estimates show the day's sales up 22 percent. (They were aware of the possibility; "pepper-sprayed shoppers" was one of the most common searches of the day, presumably right up there with "Victoria's Secret.") This Cyber Monday was apparently the largest online shopping day in history. By next year, families may be inviting relatives over to celebrate Cyber Monday with t

I was working on a roof, filling in for a sick employee when I got the news. A snowstorm was coming and I had to complete a window installation before I could get back to the office. But I was so devastated and distracted that I cut my fingertip off. The only thing I knew I had to do was ask the customer to take me to the hospital. Other than that, I didn't know what to do. It didn't make sense. I had to start with talking to my partner.

TRENTON -- New Jersey lawmakers have advanced legislation that would force state-chartered health care providers to cover certain autism treatments.
Strengths Benjamin is a good route runner and understands how to get open at the top of routes and use his explosive movements to his advantage. As a returner, he is a "one cut and go" runner who can break for daylight. The key to his game as a receiver is his ability to get open, and he doesn't shy away from contact despite his stature. He will be a true deep threat at the next level who runs crisp intermediate routes, as well, and can be productive if he gets off the line of scrimmage.

Or maybe you want to correct the record on something, or clear up potential confusion between you and someone with the same name. I do a fair amount of self-Googling to see how my columns are doing, so I grimaced when someone sharing my name aroused brief indignation for his comments about Barack Obama and John McCain.

Most schools don't just buy beef as a bulk commodity. They make purchases from distributors who put together meals, or components of meals.

Before making an offer, determine whether bargaining is appropriate.

River City Extension, another excellent New Jersey folk-rock band, is on at Lambert's shortly after the Front Bottoms finish, but I want to make sure I catch Westfield's Static Jacks. I played "If You're Young," the band's debut album, scores of times last year, but I've never seen the group in action. Lambert's had a short line; at Red 7, a club right in the heart of the action, festivalgoers are queued up around the block to get in. For the week, Sony has taken over the club, and Say Anything

Most of Santorums remarks were devoted to outlining his adherence to Americas founding principles, especially the fundamentals contained in the Declaration of Independence.

For $5 a pound, you can have your own wine delivered to three of the camps. It arrives on the mule trains that make the daily food deliveries. Our bottles were waiting for us at the May Lake camp, eight miles west of Glen Aulin. The camp is spread along the lakeshore, and it is hard to imagine a more idyllic setting for a makeshift cocktail party — a mirror-smooth lake framed by the soaring battlements of 10,800-foot Mt. Hoffman. We set out three bottles of Pinot Noir and Syrah on a tree stum

As a former St. Louis Post-Dispatch news artist, it was a hard lesson for Cook to learn himself. After graduating from Roxana High School, his creative instinct was steered toward studying architecture at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Cook said there was just one problem: he learned he didn't have an affinity for designing buildings.

Rollins could soon depart this team, but his bravado — and his comments about the Mets — aren’t about to change. As he heads into free agency, his chief competition among available shortstops is Jose Reyes, the object of the Mets’ desire. Saturday, Rollins offered a subtle critique of his counterpart, including a jab at Reyes’ decision to bunt and bolt in the season finale Wednesday to secure his place as the National League batting champ.
The Jossels and Hanak bring the same fine-dining sensibility to this restaurant as they do to Nopa, with both ingredients and service. Plates are continually changed and additional flatware is brought on a tray.

But as the Senate prepares to begin debate in less than two weeks on legislation revamping regulation of the financial industry, the question of bailouts has elevated the sharp partisan differences over how to respond to the 2008 crisis that caused a near meltdown on Wall Street.
Why? Because the "Great Recession" under President Obama has been disproportionately brutal for younger workers. Last summer was the worst job market for young people since 1948. In 2010, the unemployment rate for college graduates 24 and younger hit an all-time high.
As his campaign for Arizona's 2012 GOP Senate nomination revs up, Flake is explicitly rejecting his past advocacy for far-reaching legislation that would secure the border, enact a temporary-worker program and give many undocumented immigrants a pathway to legal status.

The cast is strong, but not vocally remarkable. It's clear the parts went to the strongest dancers because the show is an impeccably choreographed masterwork. It's almost as if the thought process in casting was to wow the audience with the dancing and then let the strength of the songs speak for themselves.

Taxpayer money is being provided through the Department of Agriculture to puppy-mill breeders to keep the breeding industry "vibrant and strong," the director, Dr. Hagler, calls it. But rescue groups and shelters will now pay up to $2,500 to take in unwanted and abandoned animals and be charged the same as commercial breeders. This according to the Department of Agriculture. What a great state.

Beyond a healthy lifestyle, women should be vigilant about any changes in their breasts. As mentioned earlier, most breast changes are not cancer, but a monthly self-exam from age 20 on and an annual mammogram starting at age 40 are proactive ways to ensure that any abnormalities are found early, when they are most treatable.

The win should also stamp out some of the bad memories haunting Dufner since the Masters, when he shared the lead after two rounds but faded to 24th. The 35-year-old Dufner also held five previous leads through two rounds — two this year, only to fade down the stretch.
Likewise, Robert Half International CEO Harold Messmer Jr. received a car allowance worth nearly $14,000 and a "personal allowance" worth $2,600 in 2006. But in February, the company cut off both.
The crowd: I've been to many bars — upscale bars, wine bars, dive bars, sports bars, and everything in between — but never have I witnessed more snootiness and rudeness in a bar. Sure, there are places where people look at you funny or you know you're out of place — The Castle, for example. But they leave you be and treat you like any other customer. At Taps, I watched four people who walked in dressed nicely, but who were obviously not tenants of Skypoint, and they were ignored at the ba
But in dealing with the public health issue of tobacco smoke, St. Charles County lags behind the state of Illinois, which adjoins it along the Mississippi; neighboring St. Louis County; the city of St. Louis; and such forward-thinking communities as Clayton, Kirkwood, Creve Coeur and, within St. Charles County itself, Lake Saint Louis and O'Fallon.

Still on the outside looking in are the titans of progressive rock, metal and post-punk who the Hall has always snubbed.

From the '90s forward, teams like Pittsburgh, Detroit, New Jersey and Colorado took turns trading the Cup, combining for nine titles in a 13-year span.

But Nunns did, despite State Department obstacles even for a 66-year-old New Zealand “national treasure” who suffers from Parkinson’s and had just been improvising with an Italian jazz band in Rome last week. He played few of the Maori instruments he had laid out on a table, and he did so quietly in a group improvisation that Vinny Golia (on many different wind instruments), cellist Erika Duke-Kirkpatrick and New Zealand percussionist Chris O’Connor also kept impressively still.
So, if he sounds to you like an odd choice for an interfaith event, congratulations! You have more common sense than the committee that chose him and the mayor who declined to press for a new speaker.

You might even trace the lineage of Simmons' flashback users to Tennyson's lotos-eaters and the story as it was told in Homer's "Odyssey." And come to think of it, let's include the English Romantic poets even though they yearned for a different kind of oblivion — didn't they wish to avoid the pains of the present with a cup filled with the waters of Lethe, the fabled underworld river that washes souls clean?

Susanna Phillips picked up the concert's operatic current with "Non mi dir" from "Don Giovanni," which Donna Anna sings to her fiancé as an explanation of why she fends off his advances in the wake of her father's death.

Arizona would be a nice fit for him. There's a warm climate, the option of a closed roof, and a wide receiver named Larry Fitzgerald.

On the other hand, if the U.S. dollar loses value as the result of a default, it could trigger buying in commodities and push up oil prices. A lower dollar makes oil cheaper to overseas buyers because it is priced in dollars. Also, traders see commodities like oil as a relatively safe investment in times of stock market volatility.

When San Mateo County voters were given the chance to follow suit, they declined. Twice in the past six years -- in 2006 and again in 2008 -- voters rejected a ballot measure that would have raised about $16 million a year for parks and recreation by increasing the sales tax one-eighth of a cent.
The pope "will visit a country that has been praised the world over for its hospitality and the good cheer of its inhabitants," the archdiocese of Mexico said in a published editorial.

It's no wonder. This aquarium is probably the only saltwater body in Florida where you will encounter 40 species of marine life in a 45-minute dive. There are no rough seas, no strong currents and the tank is only 27 feet deep. The only drawback is the constant 77-degree water temperature — relatively chilly for a South Florida diver, but spa conditions for fish, rays, turtles and sharks that hail from the Caribbean.

Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, the think tank that strongly supported H.B. 1176, predicted the process will take years. Safety valves, he said, could help inmates with their transitions back into society.

I'd be disappointed if Majerus leaves. After all, SLU reached out and gave Majerus a chance to return to coaching when no one would hire him. That should mean something to the coach. SLU gave Majerus a chance to revive his career, and he returned the favor by elevating a fallen program.

Useless because the level of offensive nuclear weaponry, the subject of the U.S.-Russia "Joint Understanding," is an irrelevance.

It takes pluck to eschew the vast repertoire of modern kitchen technology and cook all your hot dishes in a wood-fired oven, honoring the memory of a legendary anti-industrialist.

French's butchery background surfaces with a fine charcuterie board ($15), while Meyer's past in the vegetarian

At times, the story seems to have lost its way, but virtually all of the aforementioned elements come together in the final act, with sometimes stunning finality. The cast is uniformly excellent, but this is Dafoe's showcase. He's onscreen nearly every moment, and his transformation from focused mercenary to a man with multiple missions is an example of sublime screen acting.

His leadership was severely lacking. Like the Cavs, he will now have to live with the burden of being a regular season player until he proves different. The MVP is a regular-season award. Like the Cavs, right now he is a regular-season superstar. He has not carried his team to greatness in three consecutive postseasons. He's had better supporting casts each year but he's in neutral and it was plain to see in this series. He did not bring it.

Yet, no matter what we think we are getting into on our wedding day, we don't marry the person of our romantic fantasies. We get flawed sinners instead - just like us - because that's all there is! The good news is, he or she may be "right" for us, but in the sense of being someone who will share our joys but also challenge us and call us out of our selfishness in ways we never expected.

--The major question mark surrounding the Wizards at this point is the future of Andray Blatche. Blatche has just completed his seventh season with the Wizards, and his performance has been a huge disappointment, even to Blatche himself. Grunfeld gave Blatche a contract extension through the 2014-15 season that pays him around $7 million per season, to the dismay of many Wizards fans, who have booed Blatche all season long. Blatche missed five weeks with a calf injury, then returned for nine ga

The author of this memoir, the son of Grandma Huang's son, describes his father as a "poster child of the revolution." His photo was pinned on the factory notice board year after year as a model worker and later as a model Communist Party member. At one point Grandma Huang observes that, when the author's father was invited to his son's school to speak, it was a lucky thing that the family had lost its fortune before the revolution.

It's bigger than the KitchenAid model and takes up more counter space, but the fact that it has an attachment for a blender ($49.95 at Sur La Table) and small food processor ($59.95 at Sur La Table) seemed like a plus - three pieces of equipment in one (though the attachments need to be purchased separately).

In fact, although Healdsburg sits smack in the middle of three unique wine-growing regions, it's better known in some circles for its eating and its ideal convergence of locavore sensibilities with Michelin Guide standards. It's where the Slow Food Movement meets the Wine Spectator, and the only downside is that there aren't enough meals in a weekend to try everything.

Jordan: There are a number of expenses that every person is going to have whether they are in college or not. But because they happen to be attending college those expenses get associated with the institution and the cost increases that go along with them.

"New Girl" (debuts 9 p.m., KPTV, 9/20): Much has been made of star Zooey Deschanel's "adorableness," or -- gag -- "adorkableness." But what makes this comedy promising is Deschanel's Lucille Ball-like willingness to make herself look ridiculous when it's called for. The premise -- Deschanel finds out her boyfriend is cheating on her, so she becomes a platonic roommate to three dudes -- is a moldy variant on "Three's Company," but let's hope this turns out to be a fresh take on an old formula.
"Joe Frazier changed my life," Foreman said. "One day I was fighting for $1,500, $3,000 and the next day million-dollar offers started coming in. He gave me an opportunity. If I were him, I would have never fought George Foreman. He didn't have to."

CARNEY: Can I just point out to you, it's an interesting fact here that at this point -- where is it here -- in terms of Republican opposition to recess appointments, slightly ironic. I will get you the figures, but the number of recess appointments that this President has made as compared to his immediate predecessor at this stage in his presidency is a fraction thereof. And the fact is it's within the President's constitutional authority. It was exercised by both President George W. Bush and
"It was a busy place, a lot of production," Canetti said of the SEDA plant. "We went there with an idea of what models we had in mind.

We have used Facebook to send snow day messages to the kids.

"Bad Ass" isn't quite as straight-faced ridiculous as the recent winking retro-exploitation pictures "Machete" or "Hobo With a Shotgun" nor as straight-up funny as the blaxploitation parody "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka," but any film with a climax including two hijacked city buses in a game of chicken can't be taken too seriously either. Perhaps it is just difficult to compete with the strange spontaneity of something like a viral video; the way it takes on its own momentum may be something that ca

When are the liberals going to learn that big government is just as likely to be greedy, impersonal and abusive as they accuse big business of being. The difference is that you have a choice not to patronize big business. There are alternatives, don't buy your hamburgers at McDonalds (although the franchisee is likely a small businessman) go to your local diner or pub. Don't shop at Walmart, Sears, etc. seek out a local source for your purchases.

A: Arborist McMahon, who is also Desert Botanical Garden's resident cactus expert, says that smaller saguaros can still be rather tender in the full sun in the summer here. He suggests that the plant's terminal received too much light this summer and the tissue was burned. Usually, the plant will form a new bud at the top and resume growing. You should put a small piece of 50 percent shade cloth over the top next summer to protect the growing tip. Do not try to remove any dead tissue. Just let

And his congenial, rich financier demeanor does not exactly fit the angry, anti-Wall Street mood of the GOP's tea party faction.

Putting solar panels along mostly unused roadsides is much better than taking up productive farmland.

As recession washed over the economy, the space stood empty until restaurant vet Todd Steele -- in Portland via San Francisco and McMinnville -- saw its potential.

We also liked the idea of having access to a kitchen, as we carried a cooler full of snacks and sandwiches for our budget road trip.

Another reason was Buffalo became the first team to primarily show the Giants seven-man fronts. They got a safety somewhat near the box at times, but didn't buzz him down or have him really down low.

A man stands near the kitchen entrance, his arm shoved halfway down a meat grinder. As the sun heads west, diners munch on light snacks or an open-faced salmon sandwich, perhaps with a glass of wine. As darkness gathers, the little white globe lamp above the night entrance, stenciled "St. Jack," flickers to
She said it took her a long time to get her act together, and there were times when she doubted she'd make it. The turning point, she said, was getting clean and sober in 2005, going back to college and embracing her family.
Officials said few people went in or out, and the occupants burned their trash to avoid unnecessary contact, the officials said.
If the nonna as master cook has become something of a stereotype (after all, excellent, thrifty and industrious grandmas can be found in kitchens around the world), American chef Jessica Theroux at least approaches the topic with nuance and plenty of solid evidence.

The labor bureau's survey also found that women worked more hours overall than they did two years ago, especially on weekends.
Colorado's Front Range "is becoming the hotbed for fire," he said. "The wildland-urban interface. The homes being built in the foothills. The amount of beetle kill. The restoration work that needs to occur. We are set up for disaster."
"The rough's more uniform, it's more healthy, thick, more resistant, so it's going to hold a ball a little bit more," Webster said. "The fairways aren't rock hard. The only thing the golf course is getting is irrigation water, so we're controlling everything."

On April 3, Ocoee will send three prospects over to UCF's second junior day of the spring, and Coach Clint Moles said that's a first for his Ocoee Knights, whose mascot is the same as UCF's, as is the school's logo, derived from one of UCF's old logos.
"I called to ask, 'How do you guys get these records?' They said, 'Well, we don't,'" she explained. "When the statute says it's unavailable, period, there's not much I can do about it."
For him, maybe. For now.
Serrano Drive, 6:08 p.m.: A wallet and glasses were taken from the console of an unlocked vehicle parked in an open garage.
But the trees he logged by helicopter last winter had deteriorated in the three years since the fire. The poor quality of the cedar forced him to cover twice the ground and devote four months to a logging operation he expected to take six weeks, he said.
The figures could well have a bearing on market expectations over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve enacts another monetary stimulus over the coming months. Recent indicators have suggested that the U.S. economy has lost steam at the start of this year.
Despite playing a disappointing innings by his high standards, Tendulkar was overjoyed with the victory.
It isn't just that email killed the letter  the Post Service's main revenue source. Now it's the iPad revolutionizing the way publishers deliver content, and eroding the need for periodical delivery. Electronic coupons are even obviating the need for junk mail.
With speedsters in scoring position, a single would have given the Giants a lead and probably a win, but Posey could not pen that tale. There is a bigger story, the team's inability to hit in the clutch, and Posey added another chapter when he grounded into a double play.
It was easy enough to put this system into a contact lens, which is 95 percent water, Hu said. Because blood sugar can be measured from tears, the contact lens changes color when blood sugar rises.

And on his newly released "Black Radio" (Blue Note), the music breathes with an easy, unpretentious air, as if Glasper and company aren't trying to prove how hip they are but simply speaking in an expressive language that comes naturally to them.
You might call them nerdy. Actually, being on a high school debate team may be an automatic qualifier for nerd status, but at the same time it's the kind of extracurricular activity that looks mighty good on a college transcript or law school application.
Myers is 61 and lives in St. Charles. He said Goodwin, his great-great grandfather, came to the U.S. from Ireland, settled in New York and became a citizen in 1852. Myers does not know if Goodwin saw combat during the war. He said Goodwin moved to East St. Louis or to Missouri sometime after the war.
But lately my Xbox hasn't been returning the love. It's been running exceptionally loud, and in the last couple days, it has been giving me "unreadable disc" errors. I took personal exception to these messages, as the bottom of all my discs are near-spotless since my change in philosophy.
Freese called the baseball coach at St. Louis Community College-Meramec and asked for a roster spot. Coach Tony Dattoli said OK. From there he went to South Alabama and was drafted by the Padres in the ninth round in 2006. On Dec. 17, 2007, the Padres traded him back home to St. Louis for Jim Edmonds.
Right now they’re living on two pensions and some part-time work Evan has done for his former employer. Because the income for Evan’s part-time work will end when they leave the state, it was excluded from this analysis. Also excluded from this analysis is their New Jersey rental costs, because those too will end when the couple moves.

The key to resolving the situation may well rest with an aging cadre at the top of China’s Communist Party, who could either promise protection for Chen and his family in China or allow him to leave the country, possibly even to Hong Kong or Macao, as they prepare for their own leadership transition later this year.
The appointment of the Ohioan comes while the president visits Ohio to talk about the economy in an address at Shaker Heights High School. White House aides have said that Congressional Republicans seem intent on blocking the president's major initiatives, and the timing with which Obama pushed Cordray through the partisan blockade make clear: Obama was dead serious when he said last month that he would take no options off the table for getting a director of the new agency in place.
Now, I understand Mr. Obama intends to bypass Congress and have the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie and Freddie, loosen the terms (another way of saying "deregulate") of the President's Home Affordable Refinance Program. That's a program in which the government (that would be the taxpayers in this case) backs loans of up to 125 percent of a home's value. The president wants Fannie and Freddie to reduce loan fees and to waive fees on borrowers that refinance into loans wit
FEAR OF DRONES: The CIA's unmanned aircraft had al-Qaida looking toward the sky. In one letter, bin Laden suggested getting most of al-Qaida's members out of Waziristan, the lawless frontier area along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border that has been beset by U.S. drone airstrikes.
FDA and state investigators traced the listeria to machinery and pooled water areas in a packing shed where Jensen sent out 300,000 cases of cantaloupe. One of the faults cited by the FDA was a potato washing and sorting machine the farm added this year that did not allow for proper cleaning and drying to prevent bacteria.
One of Mr. Romney's most obvious shortcomings is his inability to tell stories about himself that provide a window into who he really is. His late father, George, a former Michigan governor, had no trouble doing so, humanizing himself with tales of his Huck Finn boyhood in Idaho, when he and his pals amused themselves with such antics as their nighttime overturning of rural outhouses.

The 12 counties include many high earners affected by 2009’s one-year income tax hike and will “delay decision-making on the budget,” said David Rosen, head of OLS. “It would be reasonable to expect that the people who owe us a lot of money are going to hold onto their money until May 11.”
"Our tradition and our Scriptures are so clear that we're supposed to take care of the poor, the widow, the orphan ... I think that is a rallying cry for faith communities that will unite us even when we have disagreements over other social issues," said Jennifer Butler, executive director of Faith in Public Life, a progressive multifaith organization.
"We have grown so much over the past years and we've done 14 or 15 acquisitions over the last bit. This is just a streamlining," Balsillie said. "In no way shape or form would I call this a restructuring."

Damon hit .261 with 16 homers and 73 RBI in 150 games for Tampa Bay last year. He has 2,723 hits in 17 major-league seasons. He has played 141-plus games in each of the past 16 seasons.
I can say, with honest conviction, that this was Alex's moment on the show this season. His leaps looked effortless and for once he connected with both the music and the audience. Guest judge Sonya Tayeh told him, "Alexander, this is what I've been praying and hoping for this whole season. You dove in and you looked amazing. I don't know what it is, but...the shell is broken." Nigel, in his brutal honesty, went further: "I think for a few weeks, Alexander, Sasha has carried you. That's how I fe
Ursin, the attorney for Hudson, said the neighbors’ group is “playing games” and hasn’t really achieved anything.
"This would eliminate the senior mercenary transfer," Lewis said. "Not letting them participate (at a lower level) is a punishment too harsh for a non-crime."

Like at the Aladdin, Tedeschi didn't talk much during the show after her introductory, "How ya doing?" But that doesn't matter much on a Portland-perfect summer evening, with locals sipping wine and beer on the grassy expanse in front of the stage. The sky was a clear blue. The temperatures barely called for sleeves. And the music dipped into sweet spots and muscled through fiery emotion.

Best Quote to Summarize the Series: Elena asks Damon why he doesn’t let people see the good in him. He responds: “Because when people see good, they expect good. And I don’t want to have to live up to anyone’s expectations.”
McHenry, who pays $2,100 a month, claims the district's proposed minimum of $3,000 a month is too high. Given the cyclical nature of the fishing industry, he said, rent hikes in that range could put him and the others out of business in years when catches are down.

The last time Obama commented publicly on a case of possible racial profiling was after Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested trying to force open the jammed door of his Cambridge home in 2009. After criticizing the arrest as "stupid," the president got an avalanche of criticism and wound up sitting down for a beer in the White House garden with Gates and the white cop who arrested him. That meeting sent the wrong message, implying that racial profiling is an individual problem r

Losing "American Idol's" linchpin personality as a regular could seriously damage a program other networks have enviously dubbed "The Death Star" for its ability to annihilate nearly every program thrown against it. Since its 2002 summer premiere, "Idol" has transformed unknowns such as Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood into bona fide pop music stars and routinely averaged over 20 million viewers -- in no small part because of Cowell's acid wit and often brutal frankness.
NEW YORK -- Stocks rose sharply for a second straight day Wednesday on signs that the U.S. economy grew in September and that European officials are moving to support the region's struggling banks.
By racing past Smith, a Hall-of-Famer who usually rides in California, Gutierrez completed a meteoric rise. But he also created a series of questions for Bodemeister trainer Bob Baffert, who said simply, “Wow,” as his horse's sublime run went for naught.
The Fall Creek Gardens plot involves neighbors of the Northside community and is something of a demonstration of what can be accomplished. But the resource center's larger mission is to work with neighborhood and community gardens throughout the city, including on the Westside.
No rate has been set yet, but proposals peg the rate at less than 80 cents per kilowatt hour, which will gradually reduce over time as solar panels get cheaper. In addition, residents will be paid only for the excess electricity they produce, not the amount they consume. The payment will probably show up in their utility bill in the form of a credit.

OMG!!!!! I would make trips home to my parents from Atlanta and pray I always had a Friday stay in Parma with them. The thought of a Friday fish fry makes me salivate. The best was at the Gray Wolf Tavern in Cleveland. It did not matter what time you were there because the line would come out the front door, down the sidewalk and into the parking lot. Yes, I'm missing good fish, pierogies, french fries, coleslaw, fresh rye bread and a cold draft brewsky. Those were the days that I so long for a
Oct. 23, 2011: Inserted into a game at halftime against San Diego two weeks earlier, Tebow made his first start of 2011 at Miami after the bye week. After 3½ poor quarters, Tebow led the Broncos on an improbable comeback, scoring 15 points in the final three minutes. Denver won 18-15 in overtime.
My law would only require that new saws sold in California after 2015 hit a performance standard  not use a specific technology. I am confident that saw makers are able to use the next two years to develop their own safety system at a minimal cost per saw. I am certain that employers, hobbyists and schools would rather pay the minimal upfront cost for this technology than the thousands of dollars in medical bills that can come with accidental contact of a spinning saw blade.
I suspect you understand this, your honor. I've spent enough time around you to know that you respect the law and, more than anything, want fair and impartial outcomes delivered from your courtroom.

Ildebrando D’Arcangelo has a magnificent voice and when he is focused on channeling that deep, lavish sound into lyrical Mozartian lines, the effect is stunning. He offers nuanced expression in Leporello’s “catalogue” aria from “Don Giovanni” and in “Rivolgete a lui lo sguardo” from “Così fan Tutte,” which features a lively turn by Noseda and the orchestra. He pulls back effectively in Giovanni’s serenade “Deh vieni a la finestra” and is highly affecting in a paternal

Common sense tells us that too much emphasis on tribe, ethnicity or previous nationality can be at odds with the common purpose and cohesion of a nation with a large, diverse population. But suggesting that taxpayer support of the corner Bangladeshi knitting circle or a Muslim civil rights organization causes homegrown terrorism is a little like saying sex education creates rapists.

NEW YORK — There’s plenty of tumult for Terry Collins to deal with all of a sudden. The Mets manager has seen his roster turned upside-down, inside-out and sideways.

They say China's elderly population is expanding rapidly as Mao-era baby boomers retire, putting new burdens on society to cover the cost of their retirement. At the same time, China's labor force is due to start shrinking in 2016, reversing the demographic phenomenon of a widening pool of low-cost labor that powered a manufacturing boom over the past three decades.

Part Korean pancake, part crepe; easy and versatile. For heartier appetites, fill the pancake with shredded, cooked chicken, pork, beef or seafood (or other vegetables, for that matter) or add some cooked protein to the batter. (Fish or seafood in small pieces could be added raw just before cooking; the pancake's cooking time allows these items to be cooked through.) Use older scallions with thick bulbs for this recipe; they have a more distinct oniony flavor.
Weather conditions at Shea Stadium, which actually was sold out but had about a third of the customers not showing up because of the cold, meant the absence of Joe Namath from the New York Lineup.

It takes time to build a business. But once I started getting much bigger projects, I should have moved sooner to enhance my credibility. Sometimes projects can go on for a few months, and it's hard for a client to envision completing work with spreadsheets spread out all over my house.
The effect of what happens at the top with the BCS conferences eventually will affect those below.
We start with a luscious oyster on the half shell so big that Uechi had cut it in half lengthwise. It is served with a splash of ponzu -- wonderful with a flowery chilled sake. Then comes a trio of sashimi -- chu-toro (medium fatty tuna) from Spain, tai snapper from Japan and kanburi (winter yellowtail) from the Sea of Japan -- with that freshly grated wasabi and Katusya-san's own blend of sashimi soy sauce.

How can a busy county executive stay current with something as complicated as efforts to turn around multiple troubled school districts? St. Charles County Executive Steve Ehlmann said that if he were confronted with such a problem, he would turn to his county's Workforce Investment Board.
Once again, the Golden Eagles’ stingy defense gave them a wide-open shot at advancing past one of the Big East’s most dominant powers. Despite allowing 18 points off the bench from Burlington Life Center Academy product Dion Waiters, Marquette was able to take 6-10 center Rick Jackson out of the equation. Jackson was held to just seven points in his final game.
The commission approved the $3 million fine and denied PG&E's appeal of the larger fine without comment.

Experts point to the totality of Line 109 problems as warning signs that the older, untested lines in PG&E's system are fraught with potential risks. PG&E had largely stopped replacing old lines by 2000, when it cut back on miles replaced in favor of inspection efforts to assure safety, documents show.

He compared the process to the administration's effort to evaluate and lease the Ohio Turnpike.
The last 3 1/2 years have been emotionally debilitating. The women, in seeking justice for their husbands' deaths, spend weeks at a time away from their children. They have rented apartments in the same complex in nearby Fayetteville, N.C., for the military trial, which began Oct. 22 and will continue into December. Their determination has cost them about $15,000, which they have paid out of their savings and private donations.

The book is the second for the Historic New Orleans Collection—a private collection of Louisiana materials and a museum—which plans a series on the shapers of regional music. The first—"Unfinished Blues: Memories of a New Orleans Music Man"—focused on jazz composer-producer Harold Battiste Jr. and was published in 2010.
Yesalis said many scientists were aware of foods that could skew drug tests but would not talk publicly about them. "There's no sense helping out the doping athletes by telling them what to eat," he said.
"We were too young to react then, and that's why we want to do something for the 10th anniversary," said Jake, 17.
There was no great brouhaha. It was probably because I explained the idea that the only way to dispel the notion that elected officials had to be black was to elect someone white. It isn't that Detroit needs a white savior; it is that Detroit needs a right savior. And at some point, color has to not matter.
I used to own a small restoration business that focused on insurance claims for damaged properties. I was young and in business for just a couple of years when my former partner presented the idea to merge. I was so excited about the opportunity to become a partner of a larger company. I had one employee and one truck. His roofing and remodeling company had five trucks and 10 employees. Unfortunately the deal didn't last a year.
"He was really bringing life back to Minnesota," Irving said. "It's tragic. On a fun note, that's kind of like my nemesis. It was me vs. him at times. I'm used to seeing his stats every single night, seeing how many points and assists he had. ... He's such a great player, even when he played in Spain."
Q. That's predictable after you get married. But you've been pretty lucky on the tabloid front?
Shouldering costs
She, in retrospect, put on a brave face and was clearly the more mature of all of us.
øHemsworth: One of the funniest things - I don't know if this will be an outtake - but there is a scene where we all turn to Ruffalo and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) says, "Now might be the time to get angry." Normally he Hulks out and kills a bad guy. But in one take, Mark yelled (an expletive), ran the whole length of the set and dove into a car.
I have found that although I receive an acknowledgment from the charitable organization, I hear nothing from the family of the deceased. While a thank-you would be nice, I'd mainly like the bereaved to know that I thought enough of their loved one to make a memorial gift.
"While I was the commander, was there anything sinister or underhanded taking place at the Strike Force? Absolutely not!" Ryan wrote.
Also, when my wife hopped into the car for the first time she found the heated seat controls instantly - something at least one savvy automotive editor in the office complained about.

Barack Obama has long supported gay rights, although he has shifted his position on same-sex marriage over the years.
How do you keep oil prices high in the U.S.? You don’t build new refineries and shut down existing ones, as Sunoco has done recently. The oil companies continue to make double-digit profits each quarter and know that you and I will continue to pay $4 for gasoline without significantly altering our driving habits, so they have no incentive to make the price cheaper.
With this in mind, the modern-day researchers examined 2.7-billion-year-old sedimentary rock from South Africa. Tiny pits in the rock made by falling raindrops were quickly preserved by a thin layer of fine ash that acted rather like a protective varnish. That was followed by a second layer of coarser ash that was later worn away, leaving the raindrop imprints intact.
So yeah, we're back to that franchise identity crisis for Portland, aren't we?
Some states already have this power, and several particularly aggressive states, such as Oregon and Rhode Island, routinely make insurers lower their rate increases after determining proposed hikes are unjustified.
Bodemeister, named after trainer Bob Baffert's son Bode, heads to Churchill Downs coming off a superlative victory in the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park. Sent right to the lead by jockey Mike Smith, Bodemeister extended his margin at every call and drew away to win by 9½ lengths.

The other detective admitted he hadn't listed keys found on Balfour in a 2008 report. Another item not initially mentioned was Balfour's unused transit card, evidence prosecutors say discredited Balfour's alibi that he took the subway the day of the slayings.
Amariana's biological parents admit they had problems  including their stormy on-again, off-again relationship.
* About those NCAA seedings... the one that bugs me the most is Florida as a No. 2 seed in the Southeast. What exactly did the Gators accomplish to warrant such a lofty entry point? On top of that, if you look closely at the SE bracket, you'll see that Florida is in position to take advantage of a pretty easy ride. The first game is against #15 seed Cal Santa Barbara; the second game would be against an overrated UCLA or 14-loss Michigan State; and then in the Round of 16 the Gators would see B
Ruess is not making his first go-round with fun. The 30-year-old Arizona native's earlier, scrappier band the Format earned a short-lived record deal with Elektra Records in the early-2000s and toured steadily until an abrupt breakup in 2008.
Kasich, who ushered Senate Bill 5 through the legislature -- lobbying state senators to support the partisan measure -- characterized the law as a way of helping local governments contain their costs. Opponents, however, said it was tantamount to union busting and would have negatively affected Ohio's first responders and other unionized workers.
"Is this work in competent hands?" the Stooges are asked in another of their 1936 two-reel comedies, "Slippery Silks." "Soitenly," Curly responds. "We're all incompetents."

April 1, 1940: As a Depression-weary nation wondered if President Franklin Roosevelt would run for an unprecedented third term and where Nazi armies would strike next, some 120,000 census takers went to work counting people wherever and however they could — even if that meant driving a dog sled in the Alaska territory.
"Bob Burns served the community his entire life," Stenger said. "I know his track record and he is a legitimate person and a qualified candidate."
But some political advisors argue that an election-year epiphany on the issue would be seen as simple political opportunism at a time Obama's campaign is eager to highlight principled decisiveness. And gay marriage remains controversial among at least one major constituency the president needs: African American voters. Pastors of black churches, for example, have led the effort for a referendum in Maryland to overturn the state's new law allowing same-sex marriage.
In front of the hotel is an even larger work – some 200 aluminum canoes lashed together in a heap for Big Edge, an outdoor sculpture by Nancy Rubins.
Pause. He didn't get an answer, either from his own economic-development staffers or those of the Metro Orlando Economic Development Commission, which was out in full force that day to defend how it spends about $300,000 in money from Lake taxpayers to attract companies. Perhaps they do not know.
TA's vs. Twins
Insist on quality. Just because something is free or dirt cheap doesn't mean you should take it home. Hold out for items you know you will use and that are well-made and operational.

“There will be more than the couple that are already being talked about that will compete to play,’’ Riley said.
Passage of the measure was hailed by Common Cause Maryland and other campaign finance disclosure advocates as a significant step forward at a time when candidates for state office — like those nationally — are becoming increasingly dependent on donors with deep pockets to pay for mounting expenses.
LaTourette said some Republicans disliked his proposal's tax provisions and some Democrats its alteration of entitlement programs, but it would be more likely to gain Senate consideration than Ryan's budget because many senators support the Simpson-Bowles plan.
Meanwhile Heinrich, who has sworn revenge on FDR and Tuck, makes his way to the U.S. However, "meanwhile" implies that this is an actual subplot. In reality the Heinrich business just pops up here and there, as if to remind us that these guys have jobs and what they are. A screwball romantic comedy certainly does not have to adhere to realism, but this stretches things too far.
Six years after California instituted a statewide effort to pare fat and boost fitness in its schoolchildren, the kids haven't reversed the trend of growing obesity in their ranks. But they are fitter and, as a group, have slowed the growth of obesity, according to a new study.
"It probably changed us all in a little way," said Peter Brette, Matz’s assistant. "One minute you think you got probably the best horse in the world, and then the next minute, he’s broken. You spend six months sort of hoping he can survive, and that was a bit of a shock really."
"For so many of us veterans, the idea of home ownership just doesn't seem possible, especially in these tough economic times," he added. "This still feels like a dream."
On a second shareholder proposal, 61 percent of votes cast opposed a proposal to allow shareholders with a minimum number of votes to vote in writing on issues between annual meetings. Proposal sponsor Kenneth Steiner of Great Neck, N.Y., noted in a statement that "hundreds of major companies" allow such written consent by shareholders.
It will be interesting to see how Centrowitz and Gergel do against the pros on the big stage. Both appear to be peaking.
Not that there's any real harm in "Valentine's Day." In fact, there's nothing remotely real in it at all, and certainly no surprise. (If you don't see the "twist" coming in the Julia Roberts/Bradley Cooper seatmates-on-a-plane story, you've already fallen asleep). And the jokes? At a $10 ticket price, they average out to $5 a piece.
Other websites falsely claimed their products "were legal in all 50 states."
In the preseason, Cornelius received the ultimate honor for a Tottenville football player. Longtime coach Jim Munson bestowed upon him the jersey No. 4, worn every year by the team’s top player.
Ronald Sharpe led troops into enemy territory when he was a lance corporal in the Marine Corps, but his biggest challenge occurred years later when a car accident left him in a coma for months.
Start with cocktails, end with ice cream. The perfect restaurant.
Marchand credited Paschall with bringing kids from out of the area to the original Brooklyn-based league such as Sadie Edwards and Syracuse-bound guard Brianna Butler, both of whom are now at Nazareth, to play in the spring tournament. Also the talent Paschall had on his team made others stock up on big names and big-time players in order to try to knock him off.

In interviews, though, Kevin Mock and his father, Frank, said they didn't want to dwell on the past. They wanted to talk about the 50 gleaming new vehicles on their lot, with about 100 more due to arrive in the next few weeks, and the 25 employees who are returning to work. Many of those employees were in the showroom on Monday, wearing "We Believe" buttons and greeting the occasional well-wisher who stopped in.
But in 2006, the league sold its two debt-free stores in Portland to purchase a $2.9 million commercial building in Beaverton. A hoped-for tenant for part of the building never materialized, and the league struggled to pay for the clinic and meet the mortgage. Last month, the league voted to close the clinic.

"Coach (Tom) Crean even told me he wants me to come in and be like Cody," Fischer said. "People say that I look like him and some say I play like him. I have no problem with that at all. I hope I can do what Cody has done."
She-crab bisque ($8) is a classic, while those seeking something lustier might opt for the Malbec-braised pork short ribs ($22) with all the flavorful fixings — gremolata and polenta, not to mention Gorgonzola.

I was also suddenly reminded of climbing's mental dimension, that before each step must come a judgment of whether the move facilitates ascent or leads to a dead end. Proceeding in this way, to my surprise, I reached the top without trouble, and once again had the very real pleasure of gazing down a scaled wall.

Authorities say Ivins' death capped a years-long cat-and-mouse game with investigators, in which he repeatedly offered to help the FBI catch the killer, cast suspicion on his colleagues and tried numerous forms of subterfuge.
Said O’Neill: “I hope he gets this chance to win again. Then he’d have done it all.”
If I win the fight, I should get a shot at the UFC light heavyweight title I held once before, but I'm not even thinking about that. For me, this fight in Chicago is the biggest fight of my career. To main event a massive show like this on national television is a huge honor and easily the biggest opportunity of my life.
DiVincenzo, Hawkins said, "was somewhat dismissive" when the issue came up.
Palin also angered some Americans with a defensive speech shortly after a Democratic congresswoman was gravely wounded in an Arizona shooting in January that killed six people.
But children -- and adults -- cannot live on bread alone. We asked our waiter what could be made most mild for our Indian-food newbie, and he suggested the creamy Chicken Korma, made at the lowest spice level possible. Bingo! The creamy curry with big hunks of white meat was the perfect choice. And it still had a tiny zing -- just enough for a 5-year-old.
BOISE -- The daughter of a University of Idaho professor being investigated by the school is defending her mother against accusations that she long denied wild bighorns can catch diseases from domestic sheep on the range while her own lab had evidence to the contrary.
The controlled burns began Monday and are expected to continue through Friday in the Andria Drive area of Kingsbury Grade.
At its simplest — and there is very little that is simple here — “The Tree of Life” is about a wealthy architect looking back at his childhood in 1950s Texas, where he grew up with a bitter, abusive father and an unconditionally loving mother.
Weeks after his death, the chimney problem was enough to overwhelm. She couldn't fix it, couldn't drive the seven miles into town and didn't have a neighbor to ask for help. The disability checks she lives off didn't cover the bills for the wall heater she owned but never used.
--Travelzoo, the online travel company, soared more than 28 percent after reports that it plans to sell itself to private firms.
"Based on the current economic climate, the original $35 million price is not realistic," Ross wrote. "While it represents a large share of the costs for the purchase and upgrade of the complex, it is unlikely that the county will receive any bids with that minimum price. The county should proceed with a realistic view."
Republicans want to slash $60 billion-plus from agency budgets in coming months as a down payment on larger cuts later in the year. But they are settling for just $4 billion in especially easy cuts as the price for a two-week stopgap bill to avert a government shutdown.
He was hired as a machinist last year by Phoenix's X5 Manufacturing, which makes machined-goods components and assemblies for aerospace, defense, telecommunications, medical and other fields.
I'm going with the former. And another big upset.
Mitchell said that proposals from both Republicans and Democrats call for creating commissions to convene this fall to recommend spending reductions. So hospitals may not know until then how hard they could be hit, she said.
The Indians, Angels, Brewers and Major League Baseball agreed to move the three-game series to Miller Park from Jacobs Field so the Indians could play a game. They were snowed out of a four-game series against Seattle that was supposed to begin with their home opener on Friday. When the Indians postponed Monday's doubleheader, Jacobs Field was still covered with snow.
Mr. Ponta was nominated to form a new cabinet by President Traian Basescu.
Former Florida offensive coordinator owns two national championship rings from his time with the Gators (2006 and 2008) and led the Owls to a 9-4 record in his first season as head coach last year.
I was not originally opposed to speed camera enforcement because I thought if drivers obeyed the speed limit they would avoid penalty. I was so naïve. Maryland Safe Zones Automated Speed Enforcement incurs no penalty for being inaccurate; the driver bears the burden of proving his or her innocence. Are the citizens of Maryland really safer?
"It was always a couple of ladies, one man and a little girl," Lom said. "You could tell they were part of a family."
Not wanting to risk his four-legged companion's safety, Nelson has supplied Colby with a pair of goggles, his own helmet and a seat belt.

Fogle is 97 now, a survivor of an era when men worked without nets high above San Francisco Bay and built two of the most enduring landmarks of the 20th century.
(The process will set goals, but not mandates that require local governments to adopt new rules or ordinances.)
Stoudemire went through the same ordeal in 2005 when he blew out his left knee, requiring microfracture surgery. He was one of the lucky ones who played well post-surgery.
Tea Party enthusiasts, like other Republicans, want a candidate who can beat Obama in the fall. But they also "don't want another Bob Dole as the nominee," says Schramm, referring to the 1996 Republican nominee. Dole, a former U.S. senator from Kansas, was viewed as a career politician too willing to compromise principles. He lost to the incumbent Democrat, Bill Clinton.
He and other vets who registered for the program have formed an informal support group. They share with other vets the names of about 15 supportive doctors they’ve found across the state, pledging to keep the list as private as possible, Culkin said. "They don’t want to be labeled as a medical marijuana doctor.’’
Not only did I bond with my Dad but with the citizens of Baltimore and Maryland. From sitting around a small TV in a bar watching the Terps basketball team blow a 10 point lead to Duke with 60 seconds left to chatting it up with Colts legends Johnny Unitas and Art Donovan, the buildup to "The Big Game" was enormous.
It's what Brown considers "appropriate" that should concern us.
Johnson is trying to lead USC to a fourth consecutive NCAA team tennis championship.
Gnocchi in a lemony cream sauce with asparagus ($12) didn't work; the pasta wasn't traditionally shaped and lacked the heft of potato. Paninis, on the other hand, are ably executed. In Kaplan's interpretation, they're big, messy things you could knock apart and happily gorge on with knife and fork. Roasted duck slathered in lemon aioli ($12.50), for example, is wedged between grilled with foccacia red peppers, spinach, basil and provolone cheese.
The Bichon Frise possess a thick, wavy coat. Its fluffy white coat needs to be brushed every day. Professional grooming may be needed once a month and can be expensive. They are friendly, affectionate and don't yap much or nip. They also can live well with other pets in the household. The Bichon is prone to suffer from skin disorders that can give rise to unsightly bald spots and skin irritations, which would yield vet care expenses.
Paterno handed the report on to two university executives, who have been charged with misleading investigators and failing to properly report the abuse. Paterno acted as if he were clueless and powerless - the former of which he'd never been, the latter of which he'd not been since the late 1960s, when he began to build Penn State into a football powerhouse.
The McClures are turning some of their son's legacy toward suicide prevention. John McClure held an annual crawfish boil at his home west of the Country Club Plaza, so that's one possibility for a fundraiser.
On today, Christie — surrounded by more than 50 Republican incumbents and candidates — underscored his notion that this was an act of class warfare. "Let the people decide whether there should be two classes of public servants," he said.
"There were many compelling and appealing sites that would have had the added benefit of reinforcing downtown, particularly the older core," said Fowler. His group had been advocating for properties in the central business district, including the former McCormick and News American properties near the Inner Harbor.
A tsunami caused by the quake that swept across the Pacific killed several people on a Chilean island and devastated over coastal communities near the epicenter, but caused little damage in other countries, after precautionary evacuations of hundreds of thousands of people. The tsunami warning was lifted a day after the earthquake.

Silas said he was not surprised by the decision.
“It was a great look by Zach, and I was able to put it right through the goalie’s legs, and luckily, it trickled in,” said Guida, who finished with his first career hat trick.
øHe says the evidence isn't clear on whether the average parent today is less happy than someone without kids. But he says what's "undeniable is that parents have become relatively happier than non-parents over the past few decades."
Besides lacrosse, Matt is also a golfer. Ideally, he’d meet a girl who also likes to putt around. “If she can beat me in golf that would be awesome,” he says.
Johnson looked on into the rubble from the front door, no emotion on his face. The Freeport-McMoRan skyscraper downtown could be seen in the distance, as fire investigators and insurance adjustors milled about the remains of the 10,000-square-foot home near 56th Street and Camelback Road, along the south slope of Camelback Mountain.
"I certainly anticipate a maturity level being the key intangible in whoever plays the best," Self said. "You have to put blinders on, (so) you can't look left and you can't look right.

But the two Democrats have not been charged and deny any wrongdoing.
Lohan had already done one 30-day stint in rehab and had been clearly been struggling even before her May 2007 arrest. Two months later, she was picked up again for DUI, and police also charged her with cocaine possession and driving with a suspended license. A plea deal resulted in an extremely brief jail stint and an alcohol education course, and her career continued to flounder.
Born in Jenkintown, Mr. Turner earned a bachelor’s degree in chemistry at Swarthmore College in 1933, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He earned a doctorate in organic chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1936.
Valor is a different animal. If you've paid attention, Valor hasn't gone over well because of numerous allegations — and things being proven — of the Eagles' escapades. Case in point — next year's football team will play in a new 5A league and play a full league schedule, but the games won't count in the league standings.

No, I went to work. I started working at Artmart (an artist supply store that was then in Warson Woods) and I just loved it. I loved working. I always loved working. I still love working. I did not love school. All I wanted to do was draw. I had been drawing all through school, and I looked at art schools but they wanted a portfolio. I had no idea what a portfolio was and, unfortunately, my parents didn't either.

The two studies arrive at their conclusions through different means. One involved combining and analyzing data from 61 studies that have already been published. The other used computer models to predict the health outcomes of about 44,000 simulated women who had their first mammogram at 50. They then ran the same women through a simulation in which they began screening at 40 and compared the rates of false alarms, breast cancer diagnoses and mortality in both groups.
It was a slow, steady build for Simon Posford's psychedelic electronica after Shpongle emerged in the late '90s, but word of mouth and a few select live shows have helped bring the group's mind-bending music firmly to the front burner. With echoes of everything from Pink Floyd to trance, this stuff is straight-up sonic escapism, with a visually dazzling stage presentation to enhance the journey. Shpongle made its Michigan premiere with a much-lauded set at last summer's Electric Forest festival
Others plan to hit the mall, but not for shopping. The 75-person encampment in Boise, Idaho, will send "consumer zombies" to wander around in silent protest of what they view as unnecessary spending.

Moreover, the new money would be considered a onetime grant. That keeps this year's appallingly low level of spending the baseline going forward, so the next governor who faces financial problems will find it easy to drop the onetime funding, whatever level it may be at the time, and then cut the baseline even more.

But even with its modern touches, "Sherlock" remains commendably loyal to the essentials of the brand. Holmes, for example, still hangs out at 221B Baker Street, where he plays the violin in a meditative effort to shut out life's static.

On top of the water main asset transfer, the agreement comes with an economic development agreement that, in essence, mirrors the much-touted aspects of regionalism being discussed throughout the county.
Modern medicine allows insurers to identify high-risk, high-cost customers early, and avoid them. That is why, unless it is tightly regulated, insurance is often unavailable to those who need it most, and insurers drop sick patients at the first opportunity.

An average American with an average cellphone has more information at his fingertips than did a Goldman Sachs grandee 20 years ago. Over the past half-century, bizarre new words entered the American vocabulary -- triple-dipping, Botox, liposuction, jet set, COLA (cost of living adjustment), three-day weekend, Medi-something compounds (Medicare, Medicaid, Medi-Cal) -- that do not reflect a deprived citizenry.

Sano has observed Parker's "remarkable'' career since their days in Dallas, where she worked at the Kimbell Art Museum. His primary legacy in San Francisco, she said, "is having really developed these two very distinct institutions, added to their collections and broadened their mandate.

That element provides what tension and drama exist in the largely upbeat show: Phillips had to sell the contract of the artist who would become the biggest star in rock history — Elvis Presley — for a meager $35,000 to keep the doors open so he could develop the other budding artists on the label. Phillips, of course, had no way of knowing how big Presley would get after he went to RCA Records, but the show's creators foreshadow that info to flesh out the afternoon-in-the-life session.

Dear Residents and Visitors of Hoboken,
Travel insurance is worth considering, however. For a relatively modest outlay, you can buy coverage that protects you if you have to cancel before or during your trip because you, your traveling companions or even a family member not traveling with you becomes ill and requires care.

I've been trying to find the answers to my questions. I keep watching the news and nobody seems to bring it up. On this 999 thing, I don't quite understand it. They say you will pay 9 percent on everything. Food is getting horrendously expensive these days.

“Parents need to remember that they are parents and important role models for their children; they are not their children’s friends.

The kids I see in treatment have often expressed they wish they had had more structure from their parents, not less.”

Frosted or sandblasted tempered glass would also look great.

5.John Mica. This one is interesting. The senior Republican among Central Florida's U.S. House delegation has never before appeared in the top five. And yet he pops up now -- after his party becomes the minority in Congress. So why did our panelists deem him so powerful? Primarily because he was downright dogged in his pursuit of commuter rail -- and ultimately successful. For more than a decade, the 64-year-old from Winter Park pursued his dream, despite one roadblock (or is that track-block?)

Fans of exchange traded funds might consider Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG).

Chris Korman (Ravens/NFL editor): For whatever reason, Denver seemed, to me, like the most improbable place for Peyton Manning to end up. His ties to Nashville are obvious, and the 49ers seem to be a team on the cusp of greatness.

Admittedly, chardonnay generally isn't my favorite wine variety. But I find that a chardonnay with sufficient acidity can pair beautifully with the sweetness of the crab and cut through the richness of the melted butter that's served on the side. I steer away from anything that's too oaky or alcoholic, as they can overwhelm the crab. A real plus is minerality in the wine, because it matches nicely with the briny notes in the crab.

As directed by Sara Staley, using a revised, more compact script than the '09 version, it seems fairly haphazard if well-meaning at first. The set looks hastily thrown together (the easier to tour with, perhaps).

In fact, you can save $30 a year by replacing just one incandescent with a CFL.

To soften hearts. To challenge minds. To move the masses. To initiate change.
The church has thrown the baby out with the bath water with its sense of “conscience” in its efforts against ENDA. Because of its belief that homosexuality is “wrong,” it continues to allow discrimination in the workplace. How does “conscience” fit into that? One’s conscience can be easily ignored, and when it comes to two groups in this country, homosexuals and women, the church has no apparent problem in doing so.

At Crenshaw, I see what has been sketchily described on the radio for the last couple of hours: figures rendered to silhouettes, occupying the street, advancing randomly. Shouting, laughing, they drift on foot into traffic, into the beams of headlights, as if they are truly invincible.

Given demographic trends in the developing world, the transatlantic divide in immigrant experiences is bound to grow. Fertility rates in Mexico, which a generation ago ran more than twice the level in the United States, now equal those on this side of the border.

Africa, a vastly more important source of migrants in Europe than in North America for simple reasons of geography, will be the last continent to witness the gr

His recent assault on House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's alternative Republican budget is a blunt example.

It was not until after these purchases in the early 50's that the designation "Freedom Newspapers" was applied to the Hoiles' acquisitions. Although R.C. first suggested that they collectively be designated "our watchful newspapers," the "freedom" label was ultimately selected as being far more descriptive of their overall editorial policy and outlook.

The web site The Big Lead had this observation: "Can't wait for a columnist in St. Louis to talk about how Bradford should be focusing on getting to know his 3rd offensive coordinator in three years instead of wearing bright sweaters to musical festivals while hanging out with his supermodel girlfriend and Kings of Leon."
After President Obama announced his latest effort to try to stem foreclosures last week, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said it was time for Washington to stop meddling and let the market bottom out. But the problem hasn't been Washington interference; it's been poorly designed programs and hesitant lenders. The right response to the lingering malaise in housing is to keep trying to persuade banks to take some short-term losses to minimize the long-term cost of the housing meltdown, for

Hey, Tony: Let's give it up for a guy nobody ever talks about but he's the best at what he does, Ryan Pontbriand. The guy has never had a bad snap (if so I can't remember when) in his 8+ years. His only error came when he held out his rookie year but that didn't last long. We are lucky to have him.

damage caused by tornadoes is more concentrated than damage from powerful hurricanes, such as Katrina, economists say. The tornado that devastated Joplin, Mo., on Sunday probably won't slow the overall state's economy very much, said Ben Kanigel, an associate economist at Moody's Analytics. That's because Joplin accounts for only about 2 percent of Missouri's economic output.
The moratoriums stem from revelations that bankers were swearing to the accuracy of documents they'd never read in order to keep foreclosures flowing through courthouses.

The rebuke of Ryan is a credit to the Catholic leadership, because they are displaying their doctrinal consistency even as politicians embrace church teachings selectively. Republicans hailed the Catholic bishops when they were opposing the Obama administration's policy to expand contraceptive coverage; likewise, they cite the church's opposition to abortion. But these same lawmakers have little interest in the church's position against the death penalty, or its opposition to the Arizona immigr

But they need to know that in private. If we are to take Huff at his word, his crisis has no connection to a disabling injury or even a death in the family. There's nothing clear-cut about an anxiety disorder, nor are there any lessons to be learned, necessarily, from the cases involving fellow major-leaguers Joey Votto, Zack Greinke, Justin Duchscherer and Dontrelle Willis.

The farmers are going to farm if it's profitable."
Giusti's research on anthocyanins and other phytochemicals also involves the best way to process and store these compounds. She says one of the good things about the dark-colored juices is that you can immediately tell when their active components -- the anthocyanins usually -- have gone bad. If you see a pomegranate or acai juice that's turned from a bright red to a dull brown, for example, pass it up.
Carrie Riggs, the partner of Bergman's biological mother, served as the chaperone and driver for the students.
Lomma and mechanic Tibor Varganyi arranged for a cheap welding job to repair a critical component of a 200-foot-tall crane, prosecutors say. The two hired a little-known Chinese company over the Internet to do the work and failed to take steps to ensure the repair was sound — even after a representative of the firm they hired warned in an email that "we don't have confidence on this welding," prosecutors said. The representative later said the company "could do this."

More recently, a study by WellPoint, a large insurer, found that medical malpractice "is not a major driver of spending trends."
Rob Portman's campaign saw this perspective as well, and tapped into it to win a U.S. Senate seat. Portman, a Republican, easily defeated Ohio Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, talking with voters on the stump and in commercials about his "better" plan to bring back jobs. He knew that voters worried about federal spending, but that wasn't the real issue, according to Jeff Sadosky, Portman's communications director. It was just a "tangible symptom of a bigger government."
Oz piles on the dismal: the audience, two-dozen-weak, sits sweltering (the air conditioning is broken) in the Shunia Shor and the Seven Victims of the Quarry Attack Cultural Center. (Oz slyly registers Israel's nomenclatural fossilization of the early pre-independence struggle.)

"We started on the fly trying to introduce everything with Donovan," Frazier said. "Which is hard.

Of all the fantastical scenes in "The Avengers" involving flying superheroes and gods from other planets and a flying, invisible aircraft carrier, perhaps the most logic-defying moment of all comes early in the film, when Scarlett/Natasha is tied to a chair but still manages to disarm and disable a roomful of bad guys. Even in 3-D and with the help of quick cuts and maybe a stunt double or two, this is one of the least believable tiny-actress-takes-down-sneering-bad-guys scenes in recent memory

It's a simple thing, but for someone who wasn't around hockey growing up in central Missouri, just figuring out how the line changes happened was impossible for me in the beginning," Kroenke said. "I do go to games, but when I do I'll usually come in with a couple of friends, wear a ball cap, get under the radar and sit down close. It's just a different environment down there on the boards. I really enjoy the game."

A generous mound of fresh-picked crab is arranged on greens studded with carrots, tomato and red cabbage ($20.95). Diners can choose any one of the house-made dressings -- Italian, creamy garlic or blue cheese. I prefer the Thousand Island, a dressing I probably wouldn't have anywhere else but Anchor because it goes so well with the crab and the mix of greens. The restaurant also offers a salad with shrimp ($16.95), prawns, which are larger ($19.95), or a combination of them all ($20.95).

As much as the student loan debate and Mr. Romney's reversal make for good political drama, the student debt problem is a serious issue that goes far beyond short-term interest rate extensions or whether Mr. Obama will poll as well with college-age students as he has done in the past.

One of the things I look forward to every new year is where the wine world is trending. For 2011, the word I'd choose to describe where things are headed is "balance." Wines will be lighter and less - alcohol, that is. I see this as a process that's going to move us into the next decade.
Look, if he doesn’t get your juices flowing then that’s a problem. But you know who’s problem it is? Yours. Not anyone else’s. But let’s just play devil’s advocate here. Seeing that he has all of these great qualities, what is it about him, specifically, that you don’t like? Is it the way he dresses or his style? Because if it is, that’s fixable. (Well, to a certain degree. You can’t change how someone looks but it’s amazing how much difference a new pair of jeans and sneake
With Cavaliers majority owner Dan Gilbert pledging that construction of the $600 million Cleveland casino would begin as early as next spring, city supporters are looking forward to thousands of new jobs and more tourism from this new form of entertainment.

Ultimately, al-Qaeda's future may be determined more by popular revolts across the Arab world then by the loss of bin Laden, analysts said. Al-Qaeda did not trigger the revolts but has voiced support for them. Now that dictatorships have been ousted in Muslim nations such as Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, the world waits to see what regimes will emerge.
Ulla Tervo-Desnick, a St. Paul teacher and a native of Finland, where many of the same methodologies are traditional, said Farmington is ahead of the curve when it comes to combining academics and exercise.

High gas prices continued to fuel small car sales, as they have all year. But pump prices appear to have peaked and have fallen 12 cents a gallon in the past month to $3.81. That helped boost truck sales last month, which will mean higher profits for companies. Full-size pickups rose to 10 percent of the market from 8 percent last year, Ford U.S. sales analyst Erich Merkle said.

Are we willing to sacrifice our confidence and our ability to hold our heads high and without fear because of China's threats of economic consequences for Portland? We as Americans have pride, and it's not right for us to bend to the pressure tactics of China. Trade benefits both America and China. Those who support China give the impression that if China stops doing business with us, it would only cause great losses to Oregon. But it goes both ways. If we lose, they lose too.
Since we've done the legwork, we might as well consider what qualifies Staub to run for office in New Jersey. Well, she already has a criminal record, so she's ahead on that count. Her hobbies, according to her "Real Housewives of New Jersey" co-stars, include lying, gossip-mongering, and sex in inappropriate places. We can see how those skill sets could work in Washington, D.C.

He was found on the kitchen floor.
To outsiders, an element of orchestration seemed apparent — a softening of the ground before Obama stepped forward. After all, Biden has spoken out of turn before — as when he asserted during the 2009 swine flu outbreak that he would keep his family off airplanes and subways altogether — and the White House has some practice cleaning up after such remarks.
But as the 12-round, 336-selection process grinded toward its conclusion, the former Carmel High School and University of Michigan offensive lineman became relevant . . . when he became Mr. Irrelevant, the final pick in the draft.

Francois Hollande, the moderate Socialist with a clear lead in opinion polls, condemned Sarkozy's tactics as unworthy of French politics and a sign of desperation from a president who fears he is headed for defeat after only one term. But he also expressed understanding of the 18 percent of first-round voters who backed the National Front candidate, Marine Le Pen, and he emphasized a need to respond to their complaints that conventional politics has passed them by.

No one tracks plagiarism allegations in academia nationally, so it's hard to tell how often they occur or whether they're on the rise, said John Curtis, research director for the American Association of University Professors, which advocates for faculty. Occasionally, a case will make headlines, but others are treated as confidential personnel matters, he said. Last year, two University of Kansas professors were censured for research misconduct after the university discovered four academic pape

Norris dishes up a lot here. An at-once hilarious and heart-wrenching family drama, this is also a pot-stirring parody of hypocrisy on the left side of America’s cultural/political divide, and perhaps even a subtle indictment of our ham-handedness in international affairs. There’s a lot to chew on and (like many a family meal?) plenty of discomfort to go around.

U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan said Thursday that the testimony might lead to a harsher sentence for Vitaly Borker, who pleaded guilty last year to making threats and to fraud charges.

The settlement moved more than a century ago to the peninsula's drier west side, Kalaupapa, which became the name of the national historical park created in 1980 and the nickname of the entire region. Today, only a relic of Damien - his right hand - actually lies in his grave; the rest of his earthly remains were reinterred in his homeland of Belgium.
Assistance for those affected by the closure of King-Harbor Hospital recognizes the serious consequences for residents needing healthcare. The hospital in Willowbrook closed in August after failing to meet federal standards for patient care, and the $300 million, which would have gone to the hospital had it stayed open, was in danger of being redirected to other facilities outside the county.
Now, Finance Minister Jan Vincent-Rostowski, citing "very deeply rooted structural problems" in the currency union, says it "will take several years before we will know if the euro zone is well constructed and safe to join," as he put it in a recent radio interview.

In the weeks and months after the 9/11 attacks, discussions on talk shows and across kitchen tables focused on what we had lost. More than 3,000 innocent Americans died that day. I remember thinking for weeks that everyone must be scared to death, but I can speak only for myself: I was terrified.
Echols had solved the cold-case 1982 murder of SIU Carbondale student Deborah Sheppard in 2007 when he linked Krajcir to the crime with DNA evidence. Questioned by Echols and other officers, Krajcir admitted numerous other homicides and rapes, and the attack on White.

Council members said that some regulation is needed, and that the ordinance can be revised if it proves to be impractical.
Embryonic stem cells can turn into any other kind of cell. Type 1 diabetes, researchers say, is a particularly appealing target for stem cell treatments because only one cell type needs to be replaced. The issue is trickier for people with Type 2 diabetes, because they do make insulin — their body just doesn't respond to it properly. But even with this group, Brandon says, the treatment may have potential for the fraction of, Type 2 diabetes patients who use extra insulin to control their blo
His 2008 team again led the nation in total offense (569.9 yards per game) while ranking second in scoring (47.2 points per game), fifth in rushing (268 ypg) and ninth in passing (301.9 ypg).

With pretty much every young pitcher being given an innings limit these days, why do teams start them out in the rotation and then shut them down at the end of the year? Wouldn't it make more sense to leave them in extended spring training or something like that and then put them in the rotation in May or June so they are around to pitch during the push for the playoffs?
Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema made the right calls in aggressively using his timeouts on defense during Michigan State's last drive Saturday night in an attempt to get the ball back. As it turned out, topping the clock helped the Spartans have enough time to win on a last-second throw into the end zone.
Proposition 8 backers can now ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case with an 11-judge panel, or proceed directly to the Supreme Court. Smith's dissent could be a strong indicator there will be some support within the court to take a second look at the case.

Two years ago I was working in south Texas and got the opportunity to see Pete Kozma play when Springfield came into Corpus Christi to play the Hooks. From what I saw he was out of his league then. D. Descalso was clearly a player w/ more going for him then....a better hitter, fielder, and w/ more awareness of what was going on from play to play on the field. I've been removed from the baseball scene since then (and also out of the country). What is your current take on Kozma? What I remember i
But there's another way to reach Fremont Saddle. It's definitely not for beginners, but if you don't mind a lung-busting climb, a route-finding adventure and a ridiculously steep clamber down the boulder-strewn shoulders of Peralta Canyon, the loop from Carney Springs to West Boulder Saddle, down to Fremont Saddle and out the Peralta Trail may be your kind of hike.

But that is only part of the truth. The other part is the Cavs might not be the best team for him. It is known now that they are not close to a title, it only seemed that way. He's 25 years old.

Anyway, I am fascinated by the phenomenon of sports riots. I don't even know when a riot becomes a riot. I mean, if one guy burns his couch, that's not a riot. That's just a guy who hates his couch. What if two buddies help him carry the couch out to the front lawn, and then he burns it? Is that a riot, or just a heartwarming (and couch-warming) tale of friendship?

Remove the price tag before you pour this wine: Nobody is going to believe this isn't a Cabernet in the high $20s or $30s, instead of one for $10. OK, that's a bit more than Two-Buck Chuck. But taste this one. It has the requisite deep garnet color and a lovely scent of cherries, blackberries and coffee. It's smooth and round in the mouth, tannins tucked in and soft, a lilting acidity.

Driven by public policy changes, U.S. prison populations have increased eightfold over the past four decades -- with little or no effect on crime rates. Mass incarceration has severed social networks, left one in 14 black children with a parent in prison, and created lifelong employment barriers for the 95% of prisoners who eventually return to their communities. Hundreds of thousands of young urban men grow up on blocks where going to prison has become a norm, maybe even an expectation.

The longer it takes to regain the national capacity to launch people and equipment into space independently, the more troubling the scientific and national security implications become for the United States.

In the long-run, regular exercise will help strengthen your lungs and heart, two of your most important sexual organs. Exercise can also help prevent obesity, a condition that could potentially mess with hormones -- and your sex drive.

The consequences of extra estrogen in men aren't clear, but the hormone could conceivably dampen a man's sex drive as well as his ability to perform, he says.

My family just returned from a visit to Universal Studios in Orlando. The buildings of the city streets at the theme park are just facades, but the storefronts give the illusion that there are businesses that are open and attractive. It occurred to me that downtown Cleveland has many empty storefronts that make the city seem forlorn. Using the idea from Universal and Disney theme parks, "dressing" the empty storefronts would make the city seem more vibrant.

• The Knicks were up against a wall in Game 3, and completely failed to respond, as Tara Sullivan of The Bergen Record pointed out: "This was the night they had to break their 12-game postseason losing streak before setting the new NBA record for futility.

This was their chance to come home and prove th
A. There was a lot of running, and a lot of pyrotechnics, so we were running through pyrotechnics a lot, and that can be scary. If you make a wrong turn, something can explode in your face. But that was fun, too. It was fun to use all that physical energy instead of emotions all the time.

As I wrote and I guess Ned Yost said, Sometimes they're cautious when they need to be aggressive, sometimes they're aggressive when they need to be cautious. When a team feels insecure, this is what happens  some people trying to make a big play and some people trying not to screw up. When a team feels good about itself they play the same kind of aggressive baseball all the time and live with the results.

Hey, Michael: I also share your doubts about Griffin. His physical talents (throwing, running) are obvious. I don't like his size, however, or his inability to stay in the pocket and let pass routes develop. He is a smart player, however, and all indications are that he can learn the pro game. His physical attributes might get him on the field sooner than the typical rookie, but he will need superb coaching to develop.

Moreover, the system may actually dissuade asylum-seekers from playing by the rules. Instead of applying at the border, the two-tier system encourages some to cross it illegally and apply once they're inside the country, where they more likely will be allowed to remain free while their hearings are scheduled. And the system is expensive. The average daily cost of detaining an immigrant is upward of $100, while alternatives to detention, such as electronic monitoring, are far cheaper.

As a pulmonologist practicing in Delaware for three decades, I have seen patients suffering from a variety of lung diseases. I’ve seen my patients struggle to breathe and struggle to understand why they could not breathe.

What I have not seen in all of these years is a decrease in the number of people suffering from lung disease.

As teachers, we are not looking for excuses. Educators embrace shared accountability and research-based performance measures built on valid, equitable and meaningful metrics.

A. When I try to bring in my Las Vegas ideas into the buttoned-down Cleveland establishment, sometimes people get it; sometimes they don't. In Las Vegas, all the signs are done in neon. Probably that wouldn't go over well here. When we were talking about advertising, I wanted to do something about my being from Las Vegas. Wouldn't it be great if at one desk is a showgirl helping people with a catalog, or a lion tamer walking by? People went, "I don't think so."

This seems to be the year for passion projects for the director. His energetic documentary "Pearl Jam Twenty" indulged his love of rock music, and now "Zoo" celebrates his love of family. Though neither movie reaches the level of Crowe's standout films — the autobiographical intimacy he achieved in 2000's "Almost Famous," which earned him a screenwriting Oscar, or the what-makes-Sammy-run electricity of 1996's "Jerry Maguire" — "Zoo" is definitely one from the heart.

Manguso writes that the motive behind this book is to keep his death from haunting her. Yet like Didion's magical thinking, Manguso finds herself looking for evidence of Harris' presence, hoping for a ghost. She sits on a bench in Central Park dedicated to him and waits for a sign; to an outsider, the T-shirt she sees as significant seems sadly random. And yet. In showing how the moment of his death has receded into insignificance, she writes, "no one could possibly be able to remember the mund

Amid the darker themes, there are moments of real joy on "Blessed." "Sweet Love" points to the satisfaction of marriage and a settled domestic life. Hearing her softly whisper, "Everything in me and of me is yours forever," some fans may wonder if Williams, known for using her own rough experiences as building blocks for her work, was forever closing the door on years of sass and the paeans to drunken angels.

It's hard to imagine the pretty port that Austen experienced when she arrived from Bath in 1806. Southampton then was known for its narrow medieval alleys and Tudor-style half-timbered buildings whose upper floors hung precariously over the streets. The town was a stopover in the spa craze that swept England during the early 19th century. Life in the navy towns of Southampton and nearby Portsmouth excited Austen's creative mind, fueled in part by the presence of her brothers Charles and Frank,

Morgan, an English tabloid journalist, game-show judge, and TV host, is in many ways a cry for help. CNN is clearly hoping Morgan, famed for being edgy, gossipy, and rule-busting, will attract eyeballs. The question is whether the down-the-middle channel can hang on for the ride.
I've never once joined with the crowd as they chant the classic, "It never rains in Autzen Stadium..." bit that Essig performs in the pre game. It's not for me. But just like music, tastes vary. Ducks fans love it, and as long as this is a home game for Oregon, it matters. Essig's voice calling those words ends up as much as part of the stadium as the scoreboard, the seats and the concrete.
Legislators need to get busy, as well: Ex-felons shouldn't be allowed to set up or run pain-management clinics -- termed "pill mills" by their critics.

To be clear, this isn't about denominations, or about premodern or postmodern sensibilities, or about being a cafeteria Christian (someone who can pick and choose those teachings they want to follow) or about "getting medieval" or rediscovering the Celtic influence in our spiritual disciplines.

Lowdown: Huff saw action last year, catching 19 passes for 303 yards and three touchdowns, but this season he will be asked to replace Jeff Maehl as the team's primary deep threat.

The 2.66-mile superspeedway has traditionally been one of the most exciting venues on the NASCAR schedule, in part because of the constant threat of a massive accident that can collect a large portion of the field. The mandated use of restrictor plates at Daytona and Talladega forever kept the entire 43-car field bunched in a pack, and one wrong move by one driver could trigger "The Big One."
The yield on the 30-year bond fell below 4 percent Tuesday for the first time since briefly touching that level last October. Its yield fell as low as 3.97 percent before climbing back to 4.06 percent in afternoon trading.
That fact about the Brownie I mentioned above appears at least three times in captions. There is talk of George Eastman; there is talk of the other photographers who rushed to the scene, and what they did, and yadda yadda. God knows, I love dead unknown photographers as much as the next guy, but the San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906 was not about photography. It was about about the largest city on the Pacific Coast brought to its knees. So the show isn't about photographs, whatever the

Cavallo, Joe. Former attorney for Greg Haidl. Yelled at me as the TV cameras were rolling during a press conference for only referring to his client as "The Punk." I've since ceased and desisted. Cavallo briefly defended former Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo on bribery charges while facing his own indictment for alleged conspiracy in a bail-bonds scheme. He pleaded guilty and in December of 2007 was sentenced to six months of jail - which he shrewdly arranged to serve at home without lettin

Denis Kelly remembers the era differently. He was managing director of mergers and acquisitions for Merrill Lynch in 1986.

Not, say, the fisheries minister? No, a metal band singer and a high-energy defender of Faroese customs, who has appeared on a "Viking Shores" episode and wrote an anti-Sea Shepherd song called "Rainbow Warrior" (which includes the lyric: "May your ship sink"). Just another odd twist in an already nuanced conflict.

Current situation: Once the crisis broke, the Fed acted aggressively and in various ways to contain it.

"Honestly, it's one game," Steen said. "It's the same thing I said after Game 1. It was a tough loss, but it was Game 1. It's a long series. If you start looking too far ahead, you lose focus on the task at hand. It's a cliché, but the teams that live and play by it, succeed. We won the last game. We thought we had a solid performance until the last few minutes. We'll make some adjustments and go right back at it for Game 4."

Pfizer for a second time reduced its prior 2012 revenue forecast, this time to $63.5 billion, from $64.25 billion.

The Cardinals have All-Stars and MVP-caliber hitters returning at two of the positions that Craig plays -- left field and right field. With Matt Holliday and Berkman already in place, the opening for Craig is at first base -- but only if the Cardinals don't re-sign Albert Pujols. Craig's role is in flux. He could be a regular for the Cardinals if Pujols' jumps town. He could be on the bench if Pujols returns. He could be traded if the right offer comes along and the Cardinals want to pounce on

Replace those terrible teachers at the bottom with the terrific teachers from the top? A delusion.

One of YPO's strengths is its system of forums - small groups of members who serve as a personal "board of directors" for each others' business and personal life decisions.

The investment banking community has put the turmoil of last year behind it and is now able to focus on things like IPOs again.

A (Jeff): Actually, they just started to go up, so it may be a little early to project that. One way we're trying to help our customers is we've made a major effort to find private label products, most of which are natural or organic, providing great product at a great value, so that's one way customers can save money with us.
The statement was a reference to the Republican budget approved by the House of Representatives last month that Harris and all but 10 other Republicans supported.

That's a glimpse into the private life of one of the city's most popular entertainers, but it's nothing compared with what she reveals in "Crazy Enough," her autobiographical musical opening Friday at Portland Center Stage. By turns hilarious and heart-wrenching, the show recounts how she faced a family history of mental illness and followed a wobbly path through sex, drugs and rock'n'roll into, well, stable domesticity.
Because of television, Mineo wasn't allowed to use candles in the centerpieces. Instead they will keep with the elegant-yet-edgy theme and use flowers -- white lilies and green orchids -- along with scrap metal and wire. Crushed glass will spill out from it all.

"Magicians love to cater to as large a market as possible," he said. "Comedians are specific to their own demographic, and every other level of performing arts is like that. But with magic it's different. Back in the 1950s and '60s, magicians still wore top hats and tuxes, going back as far as the 1880s. They didn't progress with the times.

What I like about tablets is that you can have the best of print and online. The tablet apps I've seen tend to be edited and organized so that it's easy to see the difference between the news of the moment vs. the day's top story or deepest investigative report. It's great for visual journalism as well; rather than one photo, you can view an entire gallery or video.
"I really felt his songwriting power on 'The Rising' album, released after 9/11," Stuart says of Springsteen's Grammy-winning 2002 album. "When I heard 'My City of Ruins,' it just stopped me. I remember it was a Sunday night, and I was walking my dog and heard the song. I stopped and closed my eyes to listen to it. It was so moving to take what happened and hear about it from an individual viewpoint. (Springsteen) took a huge event and focused it down to the personal level. I'll never forget th

The other letter was by Paul Slavin who, if he ran in November I would vote for.

After war breaks out, Rief is tracked down by Munro, who calls in the debt he incurred in Vienna. The thespian is transformed into a spy and sent on a mole hunt that takes him from bloody Belgian trenches to treacherous Swiss cafes, landing him finally in a seemingly bland London war ministry office that may be the biggest viper's nest of them all. Along the way, Rief finds himself entangled with a beautiful French agent, further muddying the river of sex and intrigue that threatens to drown th

Hopefully that will include an optional narration track. Tim Allen's version is one jackalope imitation away from "America's Funniest People"-level presentation. This goofball approach may help draw in the elementary school demographic, but it undermines the science - especially when the rival band chimps is portrayed as marauding "mob," with a leader named ... cue "The Lion King" soundtrack ...

Although Loving's book tells Twain's story in chronological order, and tells it well, at crucial points it will expand its frame to show how certain themes - slavery, war, a guilty conscience, the unreliability of father figures, a pessimistic naturalism - appear, reappear and develop in Twain's life and work.

Daily deals. Half-price mani-pedis, massages, trapeze classes and anything else that might appeal to moms have become so common on daily deal sites that it's hard to justify paying full price for anything. Just be sure to read the fine print on business hours and expiration dates before buying, Favreau warns.

The back story: Blur isn't a gay club — just gay friendly. But when it opened in the place of gay club 1470 West four years ago, the owners (who also operate neighboring Kelly's and the Chic-a-Boom Room) decided to keep the door-busting Friday night drag show tradition in tact. It hasn't slowed.

Researchers looked at 299 adults with a mean age of 78 years and asked participants to quantify how much walking they did in one week. Nine years later, after comparing baseline brain scans to updated scans, researchers found that participants who had walked a greater amount of miles weekly maintained more of their brain tissue. (People tend to lose brain volume as they age.) Researchers noted that walking six to nine miles per week was necessary to detect differences in brain volume. Longer di

That version of Cooper scored goals at a prolific rate – 40 goals in 90 games. Cooper scored 18 goals and was selected to the MLS Best XI (all-league) and an All

One thing I remember too well about that day is being disappointed by the Six Flags roller coaster. Their original mine train ride, which is still there, provided some decent coaster-like thrills, but nothing superlative. Since then, that little ride has been a nice way to introduce my young sons to coasters, but back in '71, my psyche needed roller catharsis. Why? Because I never got to ride the famous Comet at the Forest Park Highlands.

Now there could be no question  thank you, El Rushbo!  that the GOP is waging a war on women and this is all about women's health.

What it would cost: The tax would increase from the current rate of $1.35 per $1,000 of assessed property value to $1.60, for a total of $320 annually on a property valued at $200,000.

Not that guards aren't important. But the Chargers already have two starting guards in Louis Vasquez and Tyronne Green and if they want a backup they don't have to rip out their throats to get one in the first round.

Do our leaders realize the hundreds of millions in economic impact we've lost over the years because our stadium is an embarrassment? We used to have NFL exhibition games, World Cup soccer matches, big-time neutral site college football games and Wrestlemania. One by one, those events have taken their business elsewhere.

The ATP festival, which began on Friday and ends tonight, made that argument with conviction, and no small amount of aggression. This was not an event for singalongs or dancing; it was an opportunity to get lost in the squall of overdriven electric guitars and computer beats. Call it av

She and Stieg Larsson never married, but that seemed an unimportant formality compared with their deep experience together — especially in Sweden, that iconic polity of progressive, feminist values.

The Hollywood adaptation of the first book, "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," is coming soon to a theater near you.

Many are still reeling from the suggestion that the same women who supported Hillary Clinton would turn around and vote for a radical conservative like Palin out of - what? - spite? The notion that droves of women would shift their allegiances because any skirt will do illustrates an astonishing disregard for the collective intelligence of our gender. Not that this is anything new in politics, but, man, did they have to be so obvious?

My trip in May qualified as a celebration of sorts: A friend was making merry at the end of lengthy divorce proceedings. She invited four friends to accompany her, all of whom left husbands or boyfriends and kids at home for a two-week getaway.

An earlier home buyer credit available in 2008 -- which provided up to $7,500 for first-time purchases -- had a "recapture" provision, requiring payback of the credit to the federal government over 15 years, Christman said. Repayments start with the 2010 tax year, so taxpayers who claimed the 2008 credit would have an additional $500 due when filing this season.
3. When returning home after traveling, inspect purses, bags, luggage and other materials for signs for bedbugs. Take luggage and other items immediately to the laundry room instead of the bedroom, just in case you've missed anything.

If items cannot be washed, place the dry items into the hot dryer for a minimum of 30 minutes for disinfection.

Democratic Assemblyman Mike Gatto of Los Angeles hopes to revive his Assembly Bill 2464 by talking with critics about potential amendments in coming days, an aide said.
There’s a sharp high/low element running through this season’s “Justified.” Quarles has a plan to produce oxycontin in Kentucky, sell some locally and ship half the pills back to Detroit. “That’s why they call it organized crime,” he explains to the easily cowed Duffy, who searches for the bathroom in Quarles’ house and finds a man bound and gagged in a bedroom. It looks a little like a visual reference to another movie criminals love, “Pulp Fiction,” that becomes more expli
The Blazers owner waved me off and shook his head. I asked him if there was anything more he wanted to say to Blazers fans. He hurried off, waving his hands and shaking his head. He finally nudged one of his private security guards and pointed at me before disappearing into a room with a small group that included Vulcan executive Bert Kolde, who was puffing his chest out at me.
Bad teachers can be removed, though it takes time, Wood said. His brother is a high school principal who has put deficient teachers on improvement plans. With the principal's nudging, they eventually resigned rather than face firing, Wood said.

Q. Shortly after the collapse of the I-35 bridge in Minnesota (August 2007), they closed the Old Gravois bridge, and then it was torn down in March 2010. They started working on the bridge this spring but nothing has been done since the flooding. In the meantime, they closed another (much smaller) bridge on Old Highway 141 by Old Gravois Road. We sort of feel like we are stuck on an island and we can't get out. Any idea when they might finish either of these bridges? - T. Nelch

While there's strong demand in science, education and health fields, arts and humanities flounder. Median wages for those with bachelor's degrees are down from 2000, hit by technological changes that are eliminating midlevel jobs.

Defying gravity: In a provocative essay, ABC's Amy Walter notes that while President Barack Obama's approval ratings aren't great (48 percent on average, according to Pollster.com), they are rather remarkable when you consider that in some surveys, barely a quarter of Americans say the country's headed in the right direction. How long, she wonders, can people hold these apparently inconsistent thoughts?
Rapp disputes the notion that rescinding amnesty for Taylor would discourage other militants from cutting deals to end their conflicts, describing immunity and exile as ineffective inducements for lasting peace. "You just license further misbehavior," said the veteran criminal justice advocate.

And association representatives, Rainford said, have asked for two 'sweeteners." First, the city agreed to negotiate for a new contract when the original expires in three years, and, if negotiations break down, to go to mediation or even arbitration, but only concerning department workplace rules, not compensation. Second, the association asked for a commitment from the city to use half of any savings achieved in the merger to boost officer compensation.
Along with full-day sessions, the newly elected members were given a half-dozen large binders packed with information, including a glossary of terms that are commonly used in the Legislature, such as short committee (less than a quorum), sine die (final adjournment of a session), stop the clock (to artificially stop the time to ensure legislative business finishes by the deadline), and gut and amend (change the entire contents of a bill that has already passed a committee or house of the Legisl

“We formed out of two local bands,” McCarty said. “Our guitarist had to quit because his mother wanted him to concentrate on art school. We knew Eric, so we gave him an audition.

The lockout killed the mandatory rookie mini-camp and the 14 OTA (Organized Team Activities) sessions. OTAs are some of the most uninspiring things to watch or write about outside of paint drying, but they are where playbook familiarity begins as coaches walk the players through the choreography of scripted violence.
"We're . . . keeping and creating jobs in our state," Kasich says in the commercial, paid for by the Republican Governors Association. "From American Greetings to Wendy's to Diebold, we've gone to their doorsteps to keep jobs right here in Ohio."
And, perhaps most important, he showed that even the leaders can take constructive criticism. It wasn’t long ago that Antrel Rolle called him out — funny how the defense has been a clenched fist ever since — and Tuck never took that personally. There was a reason for that: What’s good for any underachiever is good for the captain.

The jabs at capitalism hit the mark. Divka takes possession of the house and, without skipping a beat, helps himself to the dinner that's simmering on the stove. Glimpses of rising nationalism register in a lower, more ominous key: A military officer dons the Serbian insignia, villagers murmur about Croatia's secession. Hope and dread arise simultaneously, if not with equal urgency; for many of the characters, the upheaval that awaits them is beyond imagining.

“Muhammad sort of sloughed it off,” she said of the diagnosis, noting the boxer’s good physical condition and exercise habits likely delayed the disease’s progression. “There wasn’t much he felt was being affected, so it was life as usual.”
But kind of more to your point, I don't know if there will ever be another follow-up to this. This kind of is just the airing it all out and getting it all on the record and telling it like it was. It forces you to think about the past maybe more than you want to and it forces you to think about the future even more, which is something I've always enjoyed immensely.

As for Faith Christian, another group of Eagles has emerged as a power. Believe me, the 3A folks hate it. On the other hand, I don't hear much whining about Eaton baseball or, say, Idalia in 6-man football. It's probably because they are public schools. As for me? I just wish we could play games and not worry about where every kid came from — when I was senior in high school, we had about 700 kids, then beat a football team that had more than 3,000.

The notion that Saudi Arabia can make up the shortfall from an Iranian disruption is impossible. Saudi oil too must pass through the narrow sea lanes of the Strait. The trans-Arabian Petroline that terminates at Yanbu can carry only a few million barrels per day, and a rush project to double its capacity would require an estimated $600 million and some two years of construction and chemical changes; this presupposes Iran would not simply attack the line with a barrage of medium range missiles f
There still isn't a cure for AIDS, so the stakes remain high. But along with its militant content, the show's also a portrait -- sometimes self-serving -- of a specific man in a specific time and place.

Picking this one won’t be difficult when you have Skylar Diggins and the Fighting Irish opening things up at home and not encountering much difficulty until they get to the Elite Eight.

So sommeliers particularly have become champions of more - and more accurate - alcohol disclosure. Perhaps that's because diners have only their own assumptions to rely on when browsing a wine list. Perhaps it's because wine directors have to pair wines with food - there's a reason one Australian winemaker dubbed high-octane specimens "cocktail wines" - or because they want their customers to walk out the door, not stagger.

"I told myself I was doing what I should have done when I first went away to school - dating and sleeping with whomever I wanted, instead of being faithful.

The worst earthquake in Japan's recorded history left a trail of blazing buildings, inundated coastal communities, wrecked roadways and potentially unstable nuclear power plants.

Voters in Cuyahoga County like to elect judges with familiar names. But thanks to the efforts of four bar groups that evaluate judicial candidates as the Judge4Yourself.com coalition, that habit is changing. Last November, two-term Common Pleas Judge Bridget McCafferty was defeated, though her indictment on federal corruption charges -- she was subsequently convicted--probably mattered more than her lousy grades from lawyers or editorial writers.
A neighbor shared heirloom "purple" tomatoes with me this summer. Wow, what flavor! At a hotel event, more multi-colored tomatoes were cut in chunks to go with bowls of chicken, tuna and egg salad, along with greens and other selections for a do-it-yourself lunch.
John Ham, a University of Maryland economics professor, said, "Good industrial jobs for low-skilled workers are basically unavailable now. In terms of social programs, it's certainly clear it's not getting easier to be poor in America with all these budget cuts.

Having just returned from a week in Bordeaux tasting six-month-old barrel samples, my own assessment is that this is a vintage of variable quality, a year of highs and lows, when choosing which wines to buy is more important than ever. If 2009 and 2010 were years to stock up on Cru Bourgeois and lesser wines, (as quality levels were uniform), 2011 is a year to buy judiciously.
San Francisco seemingly had cemented the win in the final minute of the third quarter when Akers' first career touchdown pass made it 27-10. The 49ers finished 6-2 on the road, the franchise's best showing since 1996.

R.E.M.'s first steps as members of the major label establishment were tentative ones: despite spawning hit singles, "Green" (1988) and "Out of Time" (1991) lacked both the focus and the fire of the band's earlier work. But with the elegaic "Automatic For the People" (1992), R.E.M. composed a modern American masterpiece. The album, a series of profound meditations on mortality and perseverance, aches from the first winding riff of opener "Drive" to the final lingering notes of closer "Find the R

Started by a Four Peaks alumnus, the SanTan has been pouring beer since late 2007. They keep six staples on tap, but the Devil's Ale seems to be the signature, with its malty note and strong hoppy finish. Each week the bar features a new twist on one of its beers, infusing a brew with a different spice. But it goes fast. They only make about a keg of the specialty beer each week.
Assemblywoman Mitchell estimates that at least 1,000 people came to her sub-committee to testify against proposed cuts during eight hearings spread over two weeks.
The Blazers not only feature one of the most passionate and loyal fan bases in professional sports, but also an owner who -- while controversially meddlesome -- is determined to build a winner and willing to empty his deep pockets to make it happen.

Maybe anyone who voluntarily runs the gantlet we call our presidential election process must be mentally imbalanced in some respect, but this year's crop of Republican candidates has been especially odd. Of the four who remain viable, only Mitt Romney can pass as normal — and he has that eerie, Stepford-wife quality of being so normal he's weird.
Between late 2008 and mid-2009, the government invested more than $50 billion in bailing out GM. Between the repayment of loans and GM's public stock offering last year, the government has recouped about half of that.

The Ohio Association of Election Officials last week sent Seitz a memo containing possible changes to be considered before the presidential election. The memo suggested an end to “golden week” - when voters can register to vote and cast an absentee ballot on the same day.

Elections in France and Greece reflect the anger and disillusionment coming to the surface across Europe as an entire way of life is challenged.

But even with the slight improvement in September, the U.S. deficit through the first nine months of this year is 40 percent higher than a year ago.

Last holiday season, she began contemplating the Thanksgiving pecan pie. How crazy would it be to make an olive oil pecan pie with an olive oil crust? Not crazy at all, it turns out.

All were or are teachers or professors -- educators at heart.
After World War II, educational access was broadened dramatically through a generous GI Bill for returning veterans. The payoff from that program is well documented. The Basic Educational Opportunity Grant (now called the Pell Grant) was initiated in the early 1970s with a goal of making college attainable for many students like me, who could not have afforded to go to college without such assistance. Discussions are now underway in Washington to drastically cut this program, thereby closing th

Easter in Scandinavia, like many holiday celebrations in this part of the world, is a colorful patchwork of customs, including bits and pieces of a lot of things: Passover, the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Easter bunny, cute witches, huge amounts of oranges and the occasional shot of aquavit, all of it combined into what can be described only as an exhilarating and slightly confusing Easter stew. But one thing is clear: Easter in Scandinavia is very much about food.

Full of unfair editing and innuendo, this excoriation of the Iraq war moved beyond the quiet populism of "Roger & Me" into proud partisanship, with Michael Moore declaring he hoped it cost Bush a second term.

He was accused, Smith compellingly writes, of being an Uncle Tom and a bigotry apologist with "America Is My Home." Then, confounding expectations, Brown turned around a short time later and released "Say It Loud — I'm Black and I'm Proud," a song that was widely read as a black power anthem and set the singer on a more ideological course.

Some comedians exist as a cautionary tale; he exists as an aspiration."

It also captured how the Spurs (46-16) appeared to be younger and more energetic by fighting for possesssions and making timely passes. Spurs center Tiago Splitter passed out of a double team. Spurs guard Manu Ginobili found a wide-open three-pointer. The shot bricked off the rim, but Splitter fought for the long rebound over Pau Gasol and Matt Barnes and passed to Ginobil

But the report was critical of the law's "unnecessary obstacle" requiring dentists to review medical an

Gallup's findings help paint a grim picture of mass delusion in the United States about its rising weight and the spate of health problems that come with it. American parents are notoriously poor judges of their childrens' weight, as well. The result: Primary care physicians, long reluctant to lecture their patients about weight loss, now debate how best to break the news to patients and their parents that they are above their healthy weights.

It's unrealistic to expect that the filing of charges will silence all those in the blogosphere and elsewhere who claim certitude about exactly what happened the night of Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla. Some of them are influenced by racial bigotry or political agendas, and they may be immune to pleas for patience or appeals to the reality that the improbable sometimes is true. The prospect of a trial most likely won't restrain those who have littered the Internet with supposed evidence of Martin's ba

He has become something much more than what his prison guards tried to make of him; and yet that has turned his freedom into a heavy weight. Guilt and shame and other less-easily named emotions, over what he was forced to become and those he left behind, now torment him as he moves beyond a pure survival mode of life. He wants to bear witness, to be a human rights activist, but putting himself out for public viewing brings a new kind of agony.

The film’s final, bloody act, which sees the birth of Bella and Edward’s baby via vampire cesarean (it’s what you think), almost but not quite makes up for the past hour of overwrought living-room histrionics and muddled wolf-vampire skirmishes.

For example, at the screening I attended, Mancow Muller was there with his twin daughters, Ava Grace and Isabella Sofia, who are sweethearts. No doubt he was grateful for the public service announcement at the end of the movie by the Farrellys, who demonstrated to the audiences that the hammers and sledgehammers the Stooges hit each other on the head with were rubber props.

"The player's agents are hearing from (NFL) scouts what they want to see, and that's how we put a plan together for each athlete," said Brandon Johnson, strength coach at St. Vincent. "In the case of a guy like Ronnie, he does need to gain weight. A lot of weight he gains will be lean mass. From a speed standpoint, it will actually make him faster. It's the lean mass he needs to be able to put force into the ground to run faster."
"But when we research and get down into the scouting part of it, yes. That's part of the process. It's just like when we look at defensive backs -- if they play center field and outfield, learning how to track balls, that's part of scouting."

Inspired by Sylvia Beach's famous Paris bookstore and publishing house, which closed during World War II, Whitman fashioned the 17th century, two-story apartment into a labyrinth of soft-lit, teetering bookshelves, winding stairs, a library, stacks of well-read Life magazines, and cushy benches that turned to beds at night for Tumbleweeds. Free tea and pancake brunches were served every weekend to anyone brave, or hungry enough. After brunch, the leftover, mysteriously thick pancake batter was

But this is about much more than money. It is about survival and, for those who make it, quality of life. While all eight of the Bellflower infants were listed in "stable" condition, two were placed on ventilators because of breathing problems. And a "stable" diagnosis guarantees next to nothing in terms of how they will be faring tomorrow, or five or 10 years hence. Premature babies account for more than half of all infants who do not survive the first year of life. Those who do survive often

But you can't help wondering if Vick is playing on borrowed time given the heavy punishment he's absorbing. While his extended loss wouldn't necessarily cause an offensive tailspin like that experienced by the Peyton Manning-less Colts, those counting on DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin must be concerned.

Investors have pounded stocks for more than a month because of concerns that Europe's sovereign debt crisis would slow a rebound worldwide.

Joe Terril, of Terril & Co. in Sunset Hills, goes so far as to say the European financial crisis has become a nonevent for U.S. investors.

In its last two games, Iowa should have lost at Indiana and did lose at Northwestern. How can a team like that be picked to beat any team with the talent of the Buckeyes? Stanzi hasn't been as good lately, and the Iowa back seven on defense is there for the taking. As good as the Iowa defensive line is, the Buckeyes obviously are pretty good on defense, too, and they should make it just as tough on the Hawkeyes to get the run game going.

Nice thing about being a former sideman, as Parker is, is that you appreciate the guys in your band, and when you're as good a player as Parker is, you don't play with chumps. He let all his guys stretch out, but Curtis held the whole thing down. Thus, his own parenthetical.)

The bloom is off the rose of tilapia, according to a story in today's New York Times. The flip side to what's been considered the perfect factory fish - and happens to be the most popular farmed fish in the United States - is environmental damage from “intensive and unregulated” tilapia farming, mostly in Latin America and China (less than 5 percent of the tilapia we eat is farmed within our borders).

How can she retain her own identity while merging body and soul with a most attractive specimen of the Undead? Will sex with the Other be dangerous or fun? (The PG-13 film suggests both the agony and the ecstasy: The morning after the four-poster resembles a pile of matchsticks and Bella the Mona Lisa.)

Gaiman's own story, "The Truth is a Cave in the Black Mountains," is a perfect example of that — a tale of an unlikely duo on a quest for gold in a place called the Misty Isles. You can't help but feel the venerable shade of Tolkien hovering over this story of a wee man's revenge as he and his companion search for a haunted cave on the isle. But the story also has something else: the arc of a novel, that feeling of satisfaction, of getting a full caloric fictional load of incidents and charac

So Greece has officially defaulted on its debt to private lenders. It was an "orderly" default, negotiated rather than simply announced, which I guess is a good thing. Still, the story is far from over. Even with this debt relief, Greece - like other European nations forced to impose austerity in a depressed economy - seems doomed to many more years of suffering.

Several newspapers no longer publish election endorsements. Why does The Bee?
It is of course heartening (and rare) that Ohio's suburban, rural and increasingly downstate Republican senators are taking an interest in Cleveland. But as to municipal management, that's why Ohioans elect mayors and councils -- so local people, who know local needs, make decisions locally, not in a lobbyist-choked Statehouse.

In June, Jenkins will cover his 212th major tournament, the U.S. Open at the Olympic Club near San Francisco. These days he writes for Golf Digest, but even during his 22-year career at Sports Illustrated, and before that at the now-defunct Fort Worth Press, his comic style came straight off the Fort Worth municipal golf courses where he played as a kid. In Jenkins's 11 novels, including "Semi-Tough," on pro football, and "Dead Solid Perfect," on golf, his wisecracking central characters almost
WASHINGTON -- The White House abruptly announced Monday that it had scuttled plans to hold the upcoming G-8 economic summit in Chicago, and would instead host world leaders at the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland.

With the Duncan trunk, the thought was the Cardinals have a lot of that info still available – though it will come via a different medium. Matheny said it: "our positioning and our pitch selection" will be aided by the analytics available. Chad Blair, the video coordinator who worked many years with La Russa and Duncan, remains on staff and will be essential to such advanced scouting. He has a keen eye for tendencies and weaknesses. The Cardinals also have an agreement with TruMedia, which de

Why he isn't: Detractors will tell you Mercilus is a one-year wonder -- he had one sack each of the previous two years -- and struggles at times against the run. The Lions would have the luxury of bringing Mercilus along slowly as a rookie and grooming him to take over as a starter next year.

Still, looking at the club's website did give me a general impression of what to expect — a popular nightclub with a busy schedule, ranging from drag-queen talent shows to pool tournaments; and no less than three sink-or-swim nights per week. Fair enough, I thought, so I grabbed my accomplice and hit the road.

I flew from Tokyo to Frankfurt on Feb. 3 and could feel the Dreamliner differences. My contact lenses didn't dry out as much as they usually do on long flights; same for my nose.

Still, I wasn't dragging as much as I usually am after sleepless overnight trips.

Closing the playbook in Bel-Air
Summary: This draft by no means cured all of Miami's warts, but securing a possible front-line quarterback in Tannehill and adding pieces such as Martin, Egnew and fourth-round pick Miller to the offense is certainly something to build on. Only the absence of a dynamic receiver prevents a top grade.

4) Banish the mail from the kitchen countertop: A simple envelope sorter can prevent the pile-up that occurs in the kitchen where the mail seems to always get dropped. Always stand right next to the recycling bin to discard the junk mail, and immediately sort material into sections marked for bills, invitations, and items to be filed. Hanging baskets inside the pantry door is another good technique for banning the paper pile-up in the kitchen.

Yeah, one of the reasons it took us so long to find distribution for it, is that it definitely walks a fine line between being a concert film and being a documentary about Tibet, and a documentary about the actual making of the concert and the event itself.

My mother died in 2008. At her memorial service, friends and relatives got up to share memories that emphasized her artistic talent, her easygoing nature, her sense of humor. I listened, sadness mingling with a bittersweet sense of closure. When a loved one has spent nearly a decade steadily turning into a different person, it's good to be reminded of what she used to be like.

There are valid societal and other reasons for prohibiting these kinds of "marriages," but once marriage loses its special status, the burden is on the state to articulate why other forms of marriage ought to be invalid.

Hillis sensational: Browns running back Peyton Hillis followed his 99-yard game in Arizona with a 112-yard effort against the Ravens' second-ranked run defense. Heading in, the Ravens had allowed only eight 100-yard runners in its previous 81 games and 10 in its past 98 games. One of those was Hillis' 144-yard outburst here last season.

Rosemary had friends of all ages and made great efforts to keep in touch, remembering birthdays and special occasions. Even as an elderly person, she was always willing to try new ideas. After 64 years in the Midwest and a widow at age 90, Rosemary decided to move east to Summit, near her daughter, Sally. She transferred to the Jr. League of Summit, joined Calvary Episcopal Church and took theatre trips to NYC with the Fortnightly Club. At 93, she moved to a retirement community in Manchester,
And while $5 might sound like a lot for a milkshake, you should keep in mind that this is no McDonald's, made-from-syrup, out-of-a-bag, mixed-in-an-industrial-vat, tiny-ice-crystal-filled glass of quasi dairy-like fluid. This is a real milk shake, so thick you could eat it with a spoon, topped with whipped cream that's just on this side of butter. And it's big enough to share.

Steak au poivre ($21.99), on the other hand, was gamy and robust, a medium rare strip steak that could rival a steakhouse best. It’s served with Cheddar-mashed potatoes, a bland version that nonetheless was piped annoyingly onto the plate with pastry-bag flourish. Substance, guys, not style.

The first time I saw this scientific inclination was just after the recent 40 days and nights of rain. The sun was out, the windows were down and the car filled with cut-grass-scented air. On the highway, wind buffeted us violently, but we were all so happy to see the sun again no one cared. My two oldest boys were in the very back of our station wagon, watching the world speed away from them. The air flowing into the car circulates wildly in the back, and the boys love it: their hair flies thi

In Knotts' hands, Fife was a fully realized stooge, a hick-town Don Quixote who imagined himself braver, more sophisticated and more competent than he actually was. His utter lack of self-control led him into desperate jams that usually culminated with Fife at the end of his rope, bug-eyed and panting with anxiety. Sheriff Taylor allowed his deputy to carry just one bullet, which he was obliged to keep separate from his service revolver due to past trigger mishaps.

Such a notion explains Weschler's long interest in the visual arts. His first job after graduating from UC Santa Cruz's Cowell College in 1974 was at UCLA, where he worked as an editor on a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded oral history of the Los Angeles art scene.

Quite the opposite of their Keystone State mates -- those Philadelphia Phillies -- the Pittsburgh Pirates cannot solve Pujols. He'll be leading off the next inning for the Cardinals as I type this, and he's already 2-for-2 with a home run in the first inning, a single in the fourth inning and two runs scored. In his career, he's had almost an entire season against the Pirates and what a season before Wednesday night:

Has it come to this? The film "Bad Ass" is based on a February 2010 viral video that came to be known as "Epic Beard Man" in which an older white man got into a fist fight with a younger African American man on an Oakland bus over a misunderstanding that may have had racial overtones. It was a bit confusing, definitely crazy and maybe kind of cool.

Which means we need a drill; we need to sound the alarms! We need to rise up and be the voices for our special needs communities. We need to demand accountability from our schools, our districts, our states and our federal government.

So, fine: The report proudly notes that “for any given level of benefit,” a traditional pension plan will cost less than a private-style 401(k) plan, which offers no taxpayer guarantee. But that tells you nothing about whether New York needs to offer today’s “given level” of benefits -- or whether taxpayers can afford it, as pension costs suck up 20 percent of tax dollars.

The racketeering scheme, Campbell said, involved bilking hundreds of thousands of dollars in state funds.

A colleague named Alan urged him to try running. Reluctantly, Hauge began heading out alone after work, at first alternating running and walking and eventually just running for four mile stretches. Soon he had lost m

WHAT HAPPENED: Yu Darvish kept the Tigers off balance with a mix of breaking balls and late-moving fastballs, Adam Wilk wasn't as sharp as he was last week in Chicago, giving up 10 hits and three runs in four innings. The rookie left-hander wasn't helped by his infield's defense -- the Tigers had two errors. But Wilk didn't nibble on the edges of the strike zone as he did in his first start. Despite all the early hits, the Tigers kept it a one-run game until the fifth inning.

There was a very good reason why Ohio's 1912 constitutional convention insisted on home rule for cities and villages. Then, as now, Statehouse lobbyists (and corrupt big-city political bosses, such as Cincinnati Republican George B.

Part of the problem starts at the top. Marco Scutaro and Dexter Fowler have not found their way. Scutaro, who batted .299 with a .358 on-base percentage last season in Boston, has hit safely in the last five games but is strapped with a .227 average. Fowler has not shaken his spring-training funk. Average isn't the issue with him as much as on-base percentage. He's been unable to cause havoc — he has just two stolen bases — and owns just one multi-hit game, leaving him with a .311 OBP.

Lady Gaga — whose endless touring brings her to Atlantic City and New York this month, and to Newark in April — already has made an attempt to manage expectations, telling Vogue magazine that she wrote the song in 10 minutes; a 10-minute composition is meant to be casual, tossed off, playful, derivative.
